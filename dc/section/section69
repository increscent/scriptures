On November 3, the revelation herein appearing as Section 133 was added, and called the Appendix.   By action of the conference, Oliver Cowdery was appointed to carry the manuscript of the compiled revelations and commandments to Independence, Missouri, for printing.   He was also to take with him moneys that had been contributed for the building up of the Church in Missouri.   As the course of travel would lead him through a sparsely settled country to the frontier, a traveling companion was desirable."}
