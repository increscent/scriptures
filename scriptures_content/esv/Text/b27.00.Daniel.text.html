<p id="v27001001" class="heading">Daniel Taken to Babylon</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="book-name"><a href="b27.00.Daniel.main.html#daniel-main">DANIEL</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 1 </span>In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it. <span id="v27001002" class="verse-num">2</span>And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with some of the vessels of the house of God. And he brought them to the land of Shinar, to the house of his god, and placed the vessels in the treasury of his god. <span id="v27001003" class="verse-num">3</span>Then the king commanded Ashpenaz, his chief eunuch, to bring some of the people of Israel, both of the royal family<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b27.00.Daniel.footnotes.html#f27001003.1" id="b27001003.1">[1]</a></span> and of the nobility, <span id="v27001004" class="verse-num">4</span>youths without blemish, of good appearance and skillful in all wisdom, endowed with knowledge, understanding learning, and competent to stand in the king&rsquo;s palace, and to teach them the literature and language of the Chaldeans. <span id="v27001005" class="verse-num">5</span>The king assigned them a daily portion of the food that the king ate, and of the wine that he drank. They were to be educated for three years, and at the end of that time they were to stand before the king. <span id="v27001006" class="verse-num">6</span>Among these were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah of the tribe of Judah. <span id="v27001007" class="verse-num">7</span>And the chief of the eunuchs gave them names: Daniel he called Belteshazzar, Hananiah he called Shadrach, Mishael he called Meshach, and Azariah he called Abednego.</p>
<p id="v27001008" class="heading">Daniel&rsquo;s Faithfulness</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">8</span>But Daniel resolved that he would not defile himself with the king&rsquo;s food, or with the wine that he drank. Therefore he asked the chief of the eunuchs to allow him not to defile himself. <span id="v27001009" class="verse-num">9</span>And God gave Daniel favor and compassion in the sight of the chief of the eunuchs, <span id="v27001010" class="verse-num">10</span>and the chief of the eunuchs said to Daniel, &ldquo;I fear my lord the king, who assigned your food and your drink; for why should he see that you were in worse condition than the youths who are of your own age? So you would endanger my head with the king.&rdquo; <span id="v27001011" class="verse-num">11</span>Then Daniel said to the steward whom the chief of the eunuchs had assigned over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, <span id="v27001012" class="verse-num">12</span>&ldquo;Test your servants for ten days; let us be given vegetables to eat and water to drink. <span id="v27001013" class="verse-num">13</span>Then let our appearance and the appearance of the youths who eat the king&rsquo;s food be observed by you, and deal with your servants according to what you see.&rdquo; <span id="v27001014" class="verse-num">14</span>So he listened to them in this matter, and tested them for ten days. <span id="v27001015" class="verse-num">15</span>At the end of ten days it was seen that they were better in appearance and fatter in flesh than all the youths who ate the king&rsquo;s food. <span id="v27001016" class="verse-num">16</span>So the steward took away their food and the wine they were to drink, and gave them vegetables.</p>
<p class="normal" id="v27001017"> <span class="verse-num">17</span>As for these four youths, God gave them learning and skill in all literature and wisdom, and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams. <span id="v27001018" class="verse-num">18</span>At the end of the time, when the king had commanded that they should be brought in, the chief of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar. <span id="v27001019" class="verse-num">19</span>And the king spoke with them, and among all of them none was found like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. Therefore they stood before the king. <span id="v27001020" class="verse-num">20</span>And in every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters that were in all his kingdom. <span id="v27001021" class="verse-num">21</span>And Daniel was there until the first year of King Cyrus.</p>
<p id="v27002001" class="heading">Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s Dream</p>

So they came in and stood before the king. <span id="v27002003" class="verse-num">3</span>And the king said to them, &ldquo;I had a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream.&rdquo; <span id="v27002004" class="verse-num">4</span>Then the Chaldeans said to the king in Aramaic,<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b27.00.Daniel.footnotes.html#f27002004.1" id="b27002004.1">[1]</a></span> &ldquo;O king, live forever!

Therefore show me the dream and its interpretation.&rdquo; <span id="v27002007" class="verse-num">7</span>They answered a second time and said, &ldquo;Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show its interpretation.&rdquo; <span id="v27002008" class="verse-num">8</span>The king answered and said, &ldquo;I know with certainty that you are trying to gain time, because you see that the word from me is firm&mdash; <span id="v27002009" class="verse-num">9</span>if you do not make the dream known to me, there is but one sentence for you. You have agreed to speak lying and corrupt words before me till the times change. Therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that you can show me its interpretation.&rdquo; <span id="v27002010" class="verse-num">10</span>The Chaldeans answered the king and said, &ldquo;There is not a man on earth who can meet the king&rsquo;s demand, for no great and powerful king has asked such a thing of any magician or enchanter or Chaldean. <span id="v27002011" class="verse-num">11</span>The thing that the king asks is difficult, and no one can show it to the king except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="normal" id="v27002012"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>Because of this the king was angry and very furious, and commanded that all the wise men of Babylon be destroyed. <span id="v27002013" class="verse-num">13</span>So the decree went out, and the wise men were about to be killed; and they sought Daniel and his companions, to kill them. <span id="v27002014" class="verse-num">14</span>Then Daniel replied with prudence and discretion to Arioch, the captain of the king&rsquo;s guard, who had gone out to kill the wise men of Babylon. <span id="v27002015" class="verse-num">15</span>He declared<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b27.00.Daniel.footnotes.html#f27002015.1" id="b27002015.1">[2]</a></span> to Arioch, the king&rsquo;s captain, &ldquo;Why is the decree of the king so urgent?&rdquo; Then Arioch made the matter known to Daniel. <span id="v27002016" class="verse-num">16</span>And Daniel went in and requested the king to appoint him a time, that he might show the interpretation to the king.</p>
<p id="v27002017" class="heading">God Reveals Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s Dream</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">17</span>Then Daniel went to his house and made the matter known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions, <span id="v27002018" class="verse-num">18</span>and told them to seek mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that Daniel and his companions might not be destroyed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. <span id="v27002019" class="verse-num">19</span>Then the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven. <span id="v27002020" class="verse-num">20</span>Daniel answered and said:</p>
<p class="line-group"> &ldquo;Blessed be the name of God forever and ever,</p>
<p class="line-indent">to whom belong wisdom and might.</p>
<p class="line"><span id="v27002021" class="verse-num">21</span> He changes times and seasons;</p>

<p class="line-indent">I give thanks and praise,</p>
<p class="line">for you have given me wisdom and might,</p>

<p id="v27002024" class="line-space"> <span class="verse-num">24</span>Therefore Daniel went in to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon.

<p id="v27002025" class="line-space"> <span class="verse-num">25</span>Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste and said thus to him: &ldquo;I have found among the exiles from Judah a man who will make known to the king the interpretation.&rdquo; <span id="v27002026" class="verse-num">26</span>The king declared to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, &ldquo;Are you able to make known to me the dream that I have seen and its interpretation?&rdquo; <span id="v27002027" class="verse-num">27</span>Daniel answered the king and said, &ldquo;No wise men, enchanters, magicians, or astrologers can show to the king the mystery that the king has asked, <span id="v27002028" class="verse-num">28</span>but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will be in the latter days. Your dream and the visions of your head as you lay in bed are these: <span id="v27002029" class="verse-num">29</span>To you, O king, as you lay in bed came thoughts of what would be after this, and he who reveals mysteries made known to you what is to be. <span id="v27002030" class="verse-num">30</span>But as for me, this mystery has been revealed to me, not because of any wisdom that I have more than all the living, but in order that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that you may know the thoughts of your mind.</p>
<p id="v27002031" class="heading">Daniel Interprets the Dream</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">31</span>&ldquo;You saw, O king, and behold, a great image. This image, mighty and of exceeding brightness, stood before you, and its appearance was frightening. <span id="v27002032" class="verse-num">32</span>The head of this image was of fine gold, its chest and arms of silver, its middle and thighs of bronze, <span id="v27002033" class="verse-num">33</span>its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay. <span id="v27002034" class="verse-num">34</span>As you looked, a stone was cut out by no human hand, and it struck the image on its feet of iron and clay, and broke them in pieces. <span id="v27002035" class="verse-num">35</span>Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold, all together were broken in pieces, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away, so that not a trace of them could be found. But the stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.</p>
<p class="normal" id="v27002036"> <span class="verse-num">36</span>&ldquo;This was the dream. Now we will tell the king its interpretation. <span id="v27002037" class="verse-num">37</span>You, O king, the king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, and the might, and the glory, <span id="v27002038" class="verse-num">38</span>and into whose hand he has given, wherever they dwell, the children of man, the beasts of the field, and the birds of the heavens, making you rule over them all&mdash;you are the head of gold. <span id="v27002039" class="verse-num">39</span>Another kingdom inferior to you shall arise after you, and yet a third kingdom of bronze, which shall rule over all the earth. <span id="v27002040" class="verse-num">40</span>And there shall be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron, because iron breaks to pieces and shatters all things. And like iron that crushes, it shall break and crush all these. <span id="v27002041" class="verse-num">41</span>And as you saw the feet and toes, partly of potter&rsquo;s clay and partly of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom, but some of the firmness of iron shall be in it, just as you saw iron mixed with the soft clay. <span id="v27002042" class="verse-num">42</span>And as the toes of the feet were partly iron and partly clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly brittle. <span id="v27002043" class="verse-num">43</span>As you saw the iron mixed with soft clay, so they will mix with one another in marriage,<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b27.00.Daniel.footnotes.html#f27002043.1" id="b27002043.1">[3]</a></span> but they will not hold together, just as iron does not mix with clay. <span id="v27002044" class="verse-num">44</span>And in the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that shall never be destroyed, nor shall the kingdom be left to another people. It shall break in pieces all these kingdoms and bring them to an end, and it shall stand forever, <span id="v27002045" class="verse-num">45</span>just as you saw that a stone was cut from a mountain by no human hand, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold.

<p id="v27002046" class="heading">Daniel Is Promoted</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">46</span>Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and paid homage to Daniel, and commanded that an offering and incense be offered up to him. <span id="v27002047" class="verse-num">47</span>The king answered and said to Daniel, &ldquo;Truly, your God is God of gods and Lord of kings, and a revealer of mysteries, for you have been able to reveal this mystery.&rdquo; <span id="v27002048" class="verse-num">48</span>Then the king gave Daniel high honors and many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon. <span id="v27002049" class="verse-num">49</span>Daniel made a request of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego over the affairs of the province of Babylon.
