<p class="normal" id="v43010019"> <span class="verse-num">19</span>There was again a division among the Jews because of these words. <span id="v43010020" class="verse-num">20</span>Many of them said, &ldquo;He has a demon, and is insane; why listen to him?&rdquo; <span id="v43010021" class="verse-num">21</span>Others said, &ldquo;These are not the words of one who is oppressed by a demon.

<p class="no-indent"> So they took Jesus, <span id="v43019017" class="verse-num">17</span>and he went out, bearing his own cross, to the place called The Place of a Skull, which in Aramaic is called Golgotha. <span id="v43019018" class="verse-num">18</span>There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either side, and Jesus between them. <span id="v43019019" class="verse-num">19</span>Pilate also wrote an inscription and put it on the cross.

<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">31</span>Since it was the day of Preparation, and so that the bodies would not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away. <span id="v43019032" class="verse-num">32</span>So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who had been crucified with him. <span id="v43019033" class="verse-num">33</span>But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. <span id="v43019034" class="verse-num">34</span>But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once there came out blood and water. <span id="v43019035" class="verse-num">35</span>He who saw it has borne witness&mdash;his testimony is true, and he knows that he is telling the truth&mdash;that you also may believe. <span id="v43019036" class="verse-num">36</span>For these things took place that the Scripture might be fulfilled: &ldquo;Not one of his bones will be broken.&rdquo; <span id="v43019037" class="verse-num">37</span>And again another Scripture says, &ldquo;They will look on him whom they have pierced.&rdquo;</p>
