<h2>Philemon</h2>
<p id="v57001001" class="heading">Greeting</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="book-name"><a href="b57.00.Philemon.main.html#philemon-main">PHILEMON</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 1 </span>Paul, a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother,</p>
<p>To Philemon our beloved fellow worker <span id="v57001002" class="verse-num">2</span>and Apphia our sister and Archippus our fellow soldier, and the church in your house:</p>
<p class="normal" id="v57001003"> <span class="verse-num">3</span>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p id="v57001004" class="heading">Philemon&rsquo;s Love and Faith</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">4</span>I thank my God always when I remember you in my prayers, <span id="v57001005" class="verse-num">5</span>because I hear of your love and of the faith that you have toward the Lord Jesus and for all the saints, <span id="v57001006" class="verse-num">6</span>and I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective for the full knowledge of every good thing that is in us for the sake of Christ.<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b57.00.Philemon.footnotes.html#f57001006.1" id="b57001006.1">[1]</a></span> <span id="v57001007" class="verse-num">7</span>For I have derived much joy and comfort from your love, my brother, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you.</p>
<p id="v57001008" class="heading">Paul&rsquo;s Plea for Onesimus</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">8</span>Accordingly, though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do what is required, <span id="v57001009" class="verse-num">9</span>yet for love&rsquo;s sake I prefer to appeal to you&mdash;I, Paul, an old man and now a prisoner also for Christ Jesus&mdash; <span id="v57001010" class="verse-num">10</span>I appeal to you for my child, Onesimus,<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b57.00.Philemon.footnotes.html#f57001010.1" id="b57001010.1">[2]</a></span> whose father I became in my imprisonment. <span id="v57001011" class="verse-num">11</span>(Formerly he was useless to you, but now he is indeed useful to you and to me.) <span id="v57001012" class="verse-num">12</span>I am sending him back to you, sending my very heart. <span id="v57001013" class="verse-num">13</span>I would have been glad to keep him with me, in order that he might serve me on your behalf during my imprisonment for the gospel, <span id="v57001014" class="verse-num">14</span>but I preferred to do nothing without your consent in order that your goodness might not be by compulsion but of your own accord. <span id="v57001015" class="verse-num">15</span>For this perhaps is why he was parted from you for a while, that you might have him back forever, <span id="v57001016" class="verse-num">16</span>no longer as a bondservant<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b57.00.Philemon.footnotes.html#f57001016.1" id="b57001016.1">[3]</a></span> but more than a bondservant, as a beloved brother&mdash;especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.</p>
<p class="normal" id="v57001017"> <span class="verse-num">17</span>So if you consider me your partner, receive him as you would receive me. <span id="v57001018" class="verse-num">18</span>If he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, charge that to my account. <span id="v57001019" class="verse-num">19</span>I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it&mdash;to say nothing of your owing me even your own self. <span id="v57001020" class="verse-num">20</span>Yes, brother, I want some benefit from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ.</p>
<p class="normal" id="v57001021"> <span class="verse-num">21</span>Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say. <span id="v57001022" class="verse-num">22</span>At the same time, prepare a guest room for me, for I am hoping that through your prayers I will be graciously given to you.</p>
<p id="v57001023" class="heading">Final Greetings</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">23</span>Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends greetings to you, <span id="v57001024" class="verse-num">24</span>and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.</p>
<p class="normal" id="v57001025"> <span class="verse-num">25</span>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</p>
