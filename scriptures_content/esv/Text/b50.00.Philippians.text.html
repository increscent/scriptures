<p id="v50001012" class="heading">The Advance of the Gospel</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>I want you to know, brothers,<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b50.00.Philippians.footnotes.html#f50001012.1" id="b50001012.1">[5]</a></span> that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel, <span id="v50001013" class="verse-num">13</span>so that it has become known throughout the whole imperial guard<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b50.00.Philippians.footnotes.html#f50001013.1" id="b50001013.1">[6]</a></span> and to all the rest that my imprisonment is for Christ. <span id="v50001014" class="verse-num">14</span>And most of the brothers, having become confident in the Lord by my imprisonment, are much more bold to speak the word<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b50.00.Philippians.footnotes.html#f50001014.1" id="b50001014.1">[7]</a></span> without fear.</p>

Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and in that I rejoice.</p>
<p class="heading">To Live Is Christ</p>
<p class="no-indent"> Yes, and I will rejoice, <span id="v50001019" class="verse-num">19</span>for I know that through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance, <span id="v50001020" class="verse-num">20</span>as it is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be at all ashamed, but that with full courage now as always Christ will be honored in my body, whether by life or by death. <span id="v50001021" class="verse-num">21</span>For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. <span id="v50001022" class="verse-num">22</span>If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me. Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell. <span id="v50001023" class="verse-num">23</span>I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better. <span id="v50001024" class="verse-num">24</span>But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account. <span id="v50001025" class="verse-num">25</span>Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith, <span id="v50001026" class="verse-num">26</span>so that in me you may have ample cause to glory in Christ Jesus, because of my coming to you again.</p>

This is a clear sign to them of their destruction, but of your salvation, and that from God. <span id="v50001029" class="verse-num">29</span>For it has been granted to you that for the sake of Christ you should not only believe in him but also suffer for his sake, <span id="v50001030" class="verse-num">30</span>engaged in the same conflict that you saw I had and now hear that I still have.</p>

<p class="normal" id="v50002025"> <span class="verse-num">25</span>I have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, and your messenger and minister to my need, <span id="v50002026" class="verse-num">26</span>for he has been longing for you all and has been distressed because you heard that he was ill. <span id="v50002027" class="verse-num">27</span>Indeed he was ill, near to death. But God had mercy on him, and not only on him but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow. <span id="v50002028" class="verse-num">28</span>I am the more eager to send him, therefore, that you may rejoice at seeing him again, and that I may be less anxious. <span id="v50002029" class="verse-num">29</span>So receive him in the Lord with all joy, and honor such men, <span id="v50002030" class="verse-num">30</span>for he nearly died for the work of Christ, risking his life to complete what was lacking in your service to me.</p>
