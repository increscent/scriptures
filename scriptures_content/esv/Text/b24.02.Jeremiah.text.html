<p id="v24038014" class="heading">Jeremiah Warns Zedekiah Again</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">14</span>King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah the prophet and received him at the third entrance of the temple of the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>. The king said to Jeremiah, &ldquo;I will ask you a question; hide nothing from me.&rdquo; <span id="v24038015" class="verse-num">15</span>Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, &ldquo;If I tell you, will you not surely put me to death? And if I give you counsel, you will not listen to me.&rdquo; <span id="v24038016" class="verse-num">16</span>Then King Zedekiah swore secretly to Jeremiah, &ldquo;As the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> lives, who made our souls, I will not put you to death or deliver you into the hand of these men who seek your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="normal" id="v24038017"> <span class="verse-num">17</span>Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, &ldquo;Thus says the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: If you will surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then your life shall be spared, and this city shall not be burned with fire, and you and your house shall live. <span id="v24038018" class="verse-num">18</span>But if you do not surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then this city shall be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and you shall not escape from their hand.&rdquo; <span id="v24038019" class="verse-num">19</span>King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, &ldquo;I am afraid of the Judeans who have deserted to the Chaldeans, lest I be handed over to them and they deal cruelly with me.&rdquo; <span id="v24038020" class="verse-num">20</span>Jeremiah said, &ldquo;You shall not be given to them. Obey now the voice of the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> in what I say to you, and it shall be well with you, and your life shall be spared. <span id="v24038021" class="verse-num">21</span>But if you refuse to surrender, this is the vision which the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> has shown to me: <span id="v24038022" class="verse-num">22</span>Behold, all the women left in the house of the king of Judah were being led out to the officials of the king of Babylon and were saying,</p>
<p class="line-group"> &ldquo;&lsquo;Your trusted friends have deceived you</p>
<p class="line-indent">and prevailed against you;</p>
<p class="line">now that your feet are sunk in the mud,</p>
<p class="line-indent">they turn away from you.&rsquo;</p>
<p id="v24038023" class="no-indent-line-space"> <span class="verse-num">23</span>All your wives and your sons shall be led out to the Chaldeans, and you yourself shall not escape from their hand, but shall be seized by the king of Babylon, and this city shall be burned with fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="normal" id="v24038024"> <span class="verse-num">24</span>Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, &ldquo;Let no one know of these words, and you shall not die. <span id="v24038025" class="verse-num">25</span>If the officials hear that I have spoken with you and come to you and say to you, &lsquo;Tell us what you said to the king and what the king said to you; hide nothing from us and we will not put you to death,&rsquo; <span id="v24038026" class="verse-num">26</span>then you shall say to them, &lsquo;I made a humble plea to the king that he would not send me back to the house of Jonathan to die there.&rsquo;&rdquo; <span id="v24038027" class="verse-num">27</span>Then all the officials came to Jeremiah and asked him, and he answered them as the king had instructed him. So they stopped speaking with him, for the conversation had not been overheard. <span id="v24038028" class="verse-num">28</span>And Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken.</p>

And when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, at Riblah, in the land of Hamath; and he passed sentence on him. <span id="v24039006" class="verse-num">6</span>The king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah at Riblah before his eyes, and the king of Babylon slaughtered all the nobles of Judah. <span id="v24039007" class="verse-num">7</span>He put out the eyes of Zedekiah and bound him in chains to take him to Babylon. <span id="v24039008" class="verse-num">8</span>The Chaldeans burned the king&rsquo;s house and the house of the people, and broke down the walls of Jerusalem. <span id="v24039009" class="verse-num">9</span>Then Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, carried into exile to Babylon the rest of the people who were left in the city, those who had deserted to him, and the people who remained. <span id="v24039010" class="verse-num">10</span>Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, left in the land of Judah some of the poor people who owned nothing, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.</p>

<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">11</span>Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon gave command concerning Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, saying, <span id="v24039012" class="verse-num">12</span>&ldquo;Take him, look after him well, and do him no harm, but deal with him as he tells you.&rdquo; <span id="v24039013" class="verse-num">13</span>So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, Nebushazban the Rab-saris, Nergal-sar-ezer the Rab-mag, and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon <span id="v24039014" class="verse-num">14</span>sent and took Jeremiah from the court of the guard.

<p class="normal" id="v24039015"> <span class="verse-num">15</span>The word of the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> came to Jeremiah while he was shut up in the court of the guard: <span id="v24039016" class="verse-num">16</span>&ldquo;Go, and say to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, &lsquo;Thus says the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will fulfill my words against this city for harm and not for good, and they shall be accomplished before you on that day. <span id="v24039017" class="verse-num">17</span>But I will deliver you on that day, declares the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>, and you shall not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid. <span id="v24039018" class="verse-num">18</span>For I will surely save you, and you shall not fall by the sword, but you shall have your life as a prize of war, because you have put your trust in me, declares the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
