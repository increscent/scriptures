<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">5</span>Now Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, &ldquo;I will be king.&rdquo; And he prepared for himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him. <span id="v11001006" class="verse-num">6</span>His father had never at any time displeased him by asking, &ldquo;Why have you done thus and so?&rdquo; He was also a very handsome man, and he was born next after Absalom. <span id="v11001007" class="verse-num">7</span>He conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest.
