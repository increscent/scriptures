<p id="v16001001" class="heading">Report from Jerusalem</p>

<p>Now it happened in the month of Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Susa the citadel, <span id="v16001002" class="verse-num">2</span>that Hanani, one of my brothers, came with certain men from Judah. And I asked them concerning the Jews who escaped, who had survived the exile, and concerning Jerusalem. <span id="v16001003" class="verse-num">3</span>And they said to me, &ldquo;The remnant there in the province who had survived the exile is in great trouble and shame. The wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates are destroyed by fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="v16001004" class="heading">Nehemiah&rsquo;s Prayer</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">4</span>As soon as I heard these words I sat down and wept and mourned for days, and I continued fasting and praying before the God of heaven. <span id="v16001005" class="verse-num">5</span>And I said, &ldquo;O L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> God of heaven, the great and awesome God who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments, <span id="v16001006" class="verse-num">6</span>let your ear be attentive and your eyes open, to hear the prayer of your servant that I now pray before you day and night for the people of Israel your servants, confessing the sins of the people of Israel, which we have sinned against you. Even I and my father&rsquo;s house have sinned. <span id="v16001007" class="verse-num">7</span>We have acted very corruptly against you and have not kept the commandments, the statutes, and the rules that you commanded your servant Moses. <span id="v16001008" class="verse-num">8</span>Remember the word that you commanded your servant Moses, saying, &lsquo;If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the peoples, <span id="v16001009" class="verse-num">9</span>but if you return to me and keep my commandments and do them, though your outcasts are in the uttermost parts of heaven, from there I will gather them and bring them to the place that I have chosen, to make my name dwell there.&rsquo; <span id="v16001010" class="verse-num">10</span>They are your servants and your people, whom you have redeemed by your great power and by your strong hand. <span id="v16001011" class="verse-num">11</span>O Lord, let your ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant, and to the prayer of your servants who delight to fear your name, and give success to your servant today, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now I was cupbearer to the king.</p>
<p id="v16002001" class="heading">Nehemiah Sent to Judah</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="book-name"><a href="b16.00.Nehemiah.main.html#nehemiah-main">NEHEMIAH</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 2 </span>In the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when wine was before him, I took up the wine and gave it to the king. Now I had not been sad in his presence. <span id="v16002002" class="verse-num">2</span>And the king said to me, &ldquo;Why is your face sad, seeing you are not sick? This is nothing but sadness of the heart.&rdquo; Then I was very much afraid. <span id="v16002003" class="verse-num">3</span>I said to the king, &ldquo;Let the king live forever! Why should not my face be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers&rsquo; graves, lies in ruins, and its gates have been destroyed by fire?&rdquo; <span id="v16002004" class="verse-num">4</span>Then the king said to me, &ldquo;What are you requesting?&rdquo; So I prayed to the God of heaven. <span id="v16002005" class="verse-num">5</span>And I said to the king, &ldquo;If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor in your sight, that you send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers&rsquo; graves, that I may rebuild it.&rdquo; <span id="v16002006" class="verse-num">6</span>And the king said to me (the queen sitting beside him), &ldquo;How long will you be gone, and when will you return?&rdquo; So it pleased the king to send me when I had given him a time. <span id="v16002007" class="verse-num">7</span>And I said to the king, &ldquo;If it pleases the king, let letters be given me to the governors of the province Beyond the River, that they may let me pass through until I come to Judah, <span id="v16002008" class="verse-num">8</span>and a letter to Asaph, the keeper of the king&rsquo;s forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the fortress of the temple, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall occupy.&rdquo; And the king granted me what I asked, for the good hand of my God was upon me.</p>
<p id="v16002009" class="heading">Nehemiah Inspects Jerusalem&rsquo;s Walls</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">9</span>Then I came to the governors of the province Beyond the River and gave them the king&rsquo;s letters. Now the king had sent with me officers of the army and horsemen. <span id="v16002010" class="verse-num">10</span>But when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite servant heard this, it displeased them greatly that someone had come to seek the welfare of the people of Israel.</p>
<p class="normal" id="v16002011"> <span class="verse-num">11</span>So I went to Jerusalem and was there three days. <span id="v16002012" class="verse-num">12</span>Then I arose in the night, I and a few men with me. And I told no one what my God had put into my heart to do for Jerusalem. There was no animal with me but the one on which I rode. <span id="v16002013" class="verse-num">13</span>I went out by night by the Valley Gate to the Dragon Spring and to the Dung Gate, and I inspected the walls of Jerusalem that were broken down and its gates that had been destroyed by fire. <span id="v16002014" class="verse-num">14</span>Then I went on to the Fountain Gate and to the King&rsquo;s Pool, but there was no room for the animal that was under me to pass. <span id="v16002015" class="verse-num">15</span>Then I went up in the night by the valley and inspected the wall, and I turned back and entered by the Valley Gate, and so returned. <span id="v16002016" class="verse-num">16</span>And the officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing, and I had not yet told the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the officials, and the rest who were to do the work.</p>
<p class="normal" id="v16002017"> <span class="verse-num">17</span>Then I said to them, &ldquo;You see the trouble we are in, how Jerusalem lies in ruins with its gates burned. Come, let us build the wall of Jerusalem, that we may no longer suffer derision.&rdquo; <span id="v16002018" class="verse-num">18</span>And I told them of the hand of my God that had been upon me for good, and also of the words that the king had spoken to me. And they said, &ldquo;Let us rise up and build.&rdquo; So they strengthened their hands for the good work. <span id="v16002019" class="verse-num">19</span>But when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite servant and Geshem the Arab heard of it, they jeered at us and despised us and said, &ldquo;What is this thing that you are doing? Are you rebelling against the king?&rdquo; <span id="v16002020" class="verse-num">20</span>Then I replied to them, &ldquo;The God of heaven will make us prosper, and we his servants will arise and build, but you have no portion or right or claim<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b16.00.Nehemiah.footnotes.html#f16002020.1" id="b16002020.1">[1]</a></span> in Jerusalem.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="normal" id="v16013004"> <span class="verse-num">4</span>Now before this, Eliashib the priest, who was appointed over the chambers of the house of our God, and who was related to Tobiah, <span id="v16013005" class="verse-num">5</span>prepared for Tobiah a large chamber where they had previously put the grain offering, the frankincense, the vessels, and the tithes of grain, wine, and oil, which were given by commandment to the Levites, singers, and gatekeepers, and the contributions for the priests. <span id="v16013006" class="verse-num">6</span>While this was taking place, I was not in Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I went to the king. And after some time I asked leave of the king <span id="v16013007" class="verse-num">7</span>and came to Jerusalem, and I then discovered the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, preparing for him a chamber in the courts of the house of God. <span id="v16013008" class="verse-num">8</span>And I was very angry, and I threw all the household furniture of Tobiah out of the chamber. <span id="v16013009" class="verse-num">9</span>Then I gave orders, and they cleansed the chambers, and I brought back there the vessels of the house of God, with the grain offering and the frankincense.</p>
<p class="normal" id="v16013010"> <span class="verse-num">10</span>I also found out that the portions of the Levites had not been given to them, so that the Levites and the singers, who did the work, had fled each to his field. <span id="v16013011" class="verse-num">11</span>So I confronted the officials and said, &ldquo;Why is the house of God forsaken?&rdquo; And I gathered them together and set them in their stations. <span id="v16013012" class="verse-num">12</span>Then all Judah brought the tithe of the grain, wine, and oil into the storehouses. <span id="v16013013" class="verse-num">13</span>And I appointed as treasurers over the storehouses Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah of the Levites, and as their assistant Hanan the son of Zaccur, son of Mattaniah, for they were considered reliable, and their duty was to distribute to their brothers. <span id="v16013014" class="verse-num">14</span>Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and do not wipe out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God and for his service.</p>
<p class="normal" id="v16013015"> <span class="verse-num">15</span>In those days I saw in Judah people treading winepresses on the Sabbath, and bringing in heaps of grain and loading them on donkeys, and also wine, grapes, figs, and all kinds of loads, which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. And I warned them on the day when they sold food. <span id="v16013016" class="verse-num">16</span>Tyrians also, who lived in the city, brought in fish and all kinds of goods and sold them on the Sabbath to the people of Judah, in Jerusalem itself! <span id="v16013017" class="verse-num">17</span>Then I confronted the nobles of Judah and said to them, &ldquo;What is this evil thing that you are doing, profaning the Sabbath day? <span id="v16013018" class="verse-num">18</span>Did not your fathers act in this way, and did not our God bring all this disaster<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b16.00.Nehemiah.footnotes.html#f16013018.1" id="b16013018.1">[1]</a></span> on us and on this city?

<p class="normal" id="v16013019"> <span class="verse-num">19</span>As soon as it began to grow dark at the gates of Jerusalem before the Sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut and gave orders that they should not be opened until after the Sabbath. And I stationed some of my servants at the gates, that no load might be brought in on the Sabbath day. <span id="v16013020" class="verse-num">20</span>Then the merchants and sellers of all kinds of wares lodged outside Jerusalem once or twice. <span id="v16013021" class="verse-num">21</span>But I warned them and said to them, &ldquo;Why do you lodge outside the wall? If you do so again, I will lay hands on you.&rdquo; From that time on they did not come on the Sabbath. <span id="v16013022" class="verse-num">22</span>Then I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves and come and guard the gates, to keep the Sabbath day holy. Remember this also in my favor, O my God, and spare me according to the greatness of your steadfast love.</p>
<p class="normal" id="v16013023"> <span class="verse-num">23</span>In those days also I saw the Jews who had married women of Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab. <span id="v16013024" class="verse-num">24</span>And half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod, and they could not speak the language of Judah, but only the language of each people. <span id="v16013025" class="verse-num">25</span>And I confronted them and cursed them and beat some of them and pulled out their hair. And I made them take an oath in the name of God, saying, &ldquo;You shall not give your daughters to their sons, or take their daughters for your sons or for yourselves. <span id="v16013026" class="verse-num">26</span>Did not Solomon king of Israel sin on account of such women? Among the many nations there was no king like him, and he was beloved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel. Nevertheless, foreign women made even him to sin. <span id="v16013027" class="verse-num">27</span>Shall we then listen to you and do all this great evil and act treacherously against our God by marrying foreign women?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="normal" id="v16013028"> <span class="verse-num">28</span>And one of the sons of Jehoiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was the son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite.

<p class="normal" id="v16013030"> <span class="verse-num">30</span>Thus I cleansed them from everything foreign, and I established the duties of the priests and Levites, each in his work; <span id="v16013031" class="verse-num">31</span>and I provided for the wood offering at appointed times, and for the firstfruits.</p>
<p>Remember me, O my God, for good.</p>
