And I likewise will go with you into the territory allotted to you.&rdquo; So Simeon went with him. <span id="v07001004" class="verse-num">4</span>Then Judah went up and the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> gave the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand, and they defeated 10,000 of them at Bezek. <span id="v07001005" class="verse-num">5</span>They found Adoni-bezek at Bezek and fought against him and defeated the Canaanites and the Perizzites. <span id="v07001006" class="verse-num">6</span>Adoni-bezek fled, but they pursued him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and his big toes. <span id="v07001007" class="verse-num">7</span>And Adoni-bezek said, &ldquo;Seventy kings with their thumbs and their big toes cut off used to pick up scraps under my table. As I have done, so God has repaid me.&rdquo; And they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.</p>
<p class="normal" id="v07001008"> <span class="verse-num">8</span>And the men of Judah fought against Jerusalem and captured it and struck it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire. <span id="v07001009" class="verse-num">9</span>And afterward the men of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the hill country, in the Negeb, and in the lowland. <span id="v07001010" class="verse-num">10</span>And Judah went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron (now the name of Hebron was formerly Kiriath-arba), and they defeated Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai.</p>
<p class="normal" id="v07001011"> <span class="verse-num">11</span>From there they went against the inhabitants of Debir. The name of Debir was formerly Kiriath-sepher. <span id="v07001012" class="verse-num">12</span>And Caleb said, &ldquo;He who attacks Kiriath-sepher and captures it, I will give him Achsah my daughter for a wife.&rdquo; <span id="v07001013" class="verse-num">13</span>And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb&rsquo;s younger brother, captured it. And he gave him Achsah his daughter for a wife. <span id="v07001014" class="verse-num">14</span>When she came to him, she urged him to ask her father for a field. And she dismounted from her donkey, and Caleb said to her, &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; <span id="v07001015" class="verse-num">15</span>She said to him, &ldquo;Give me a blessing. Since you have set me in the land of the Negeb, give me also springs of water.&rdquo; And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.</p>
<p class="normal" id="v07001016"> <span class="verse-num">16</span>And the descendants of the Kenite, Moses&rsquo; father-in-law, went up with the people of Judah from the city of palms into the wilderness of Judah, which lies in the Negeb near Arad, and they went and settled with the people. <span id="v07001017" class="verse-num">17</span>And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they defeated the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath and devoted it to destruction.

And he drove out from it the three sons of Anak. <span id="v07001021" class="verse-num">21</span>But the people of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who lived in Jerusalem, so the Jebusites have lived with the people of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.</p>
<p class="normal" id="v07001022"> <span class="verse-num">22</span>The house of Joseph also went up against Bethel, and the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> was with them. <span id="v07001023" class="verse-num">23</span>And the house of Joseph scouted out Bethel.

<p class="normal" id="v07001029"> <span class="verse-num">29</span>And Ephraim did not drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer, so the Canaanites lived in Gezer among them.</p>
<p class="normal" id="v07001030"> <span class="verse-num">30</span>Zebulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, or the inhabitants of Nahalol, so the Canaanites lived among them, but became subject to forced labor.</p>

<p class="normal" id="v07001033"> <span class="verse-num">33</span>Naphtali did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, or the inhabitants of Beth-anath, so they lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land.

<p class="normal" id="v07001034"> <span class="verse-num">34</span>The Amorites pressed the people of Dan back into the hill country, for they did not allow them to come down to the plain. <span id="v07001035" class="verse-num">35</span>The Amorites persisted in dwelling in Mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim, but the hand of the house of Joseph rested heavily on them, and they became subject to forced labor. <span id="v07001036" class="verse-num">36</span>And the border of the Amorites ran from the ascent of Akrabbim, from Sela and upward.</p>

<p class="no-indent"> <span class="book-name"><a href="b07.00.Judges.main.html#judges-main">JUDGES</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 2 </span>Now the angel of the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> went up from Gilgal to Bochim.

<p id="v07002006" class="heading">The Death of Joshua</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">6</span>When Joshua dismissed the people, the people of Israel went each to his inheritance to take possession of the land. <span id="v07002007" class="verse-num">7</span>And the people served the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work that the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> had done for Israel. <span id="v07002008" class="verse-num">8</span>And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>, died at the age of 110 years. <span id="v07002009" class="verse-num">9</span>And they buried him within the boundaries of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, north of the mountain of Gaash. <span id="v07002010" class="verse-num">10</span>And all that generation also were gathered to their fathers.

<p id="v07002011" class="heading">Israel&rsquo;s Unfaithfulness</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">11</span>And the people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> and served the Baals. <span id="v07002012" class="verse-num">12</span>And they abandoned the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>, the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt. They went after other gods, from among the gods of the peoples who were around them, and bowed down to them. And they provoked the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> to anger. <span id="v07002013" class="verse-num">13</span>They abandoned the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> and served the Baals and the Ashtaroth. <span id="v07002014" class="verse-num">14</span>So the anger of the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> was kindled against Israel, and he gave them over to plunderers, who plundered them. And he sold them into the hand of their surrounding enemies, so that they could no longer withstand their enemies. <span id="v07002015" class="verse-num">15</span>Whenever they marched out, the hand of the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> was against them for harm, as the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> had warned, and as the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> had sworn to them. And they were in terrible distress.</p>
<p id="v07002016" class="heading">The L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> Raises Up Judges</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">16</span>Then the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> raised up judges, who saved them out of the hand of those who plundered them. <span id="v07002017" class="verse-num">17</span>Yet they did not listen to their judges, for they whored after other gods and bowed down to them. They soon turned aside from the way in which their fathers had walked, who had obeyed the commandments of the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>, and they did not do so. <span id="v07002018" class="verse-num">18</span>Whenever the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> raised up judges for them, the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> was with the judge, and he saved them from the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge. For the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> was moved to pity by their groaning because of those who afflicted and oppressed them. <span id="v07002019" class="verse-num">19</span>But whenever the judge died, they turned back and were more corrupt than their fathers, going after other gods, serving them and bowing down to them. They did not drop any of their practices or their stubborn ways. <span id="v07002020" class="verse-num">20</span>So the anger of the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> was kindled against Israel, and he said, &ldquo;Because this people have transgressed my covenant that I commanded their fathers and have not obeyed my voice, <span id="v07002021" class="verse-num">21</span>I will no longer drive out before them any of the nations that Joshua left when he died, <span id="v07002022" class="verse-num">22</span>in order to test Israel by them, whether they will take care to walk in the way of the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> as their fathers did, or not.&rdquo; <span id="v07002023" class="verse-num">23</span>So the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> left those nations, not driving them out quickly, and he did not give them into the hand of Joshua.</p>

<p id="v07003007" class="heading">Othniel</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">7</span>And the people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>. They forgot the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> their God and served the Baals and the Asheroth. <span id="v07003008" class="verse-num">8</span>Therefore the anger of the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia.

<p id="v07003012" class="heading">Ehud</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>And the people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>, and the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done what was evil in the sight of the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>. <span id="v07003013" class="verse-num">13</span>He gathered to himself the Ammonites and the Amalekites, and went and defeated Israel.

The people of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab. <span id="v07003016" class="verse-num">16</span>And Ehud made for himself a sword with two edges, a cubit<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b07.00.Judges.footnotes.html#f07003016.1" id="b07003016.1">[1]</a></span> in length, and he bound it on his right thigh under his clothes. <span id="v07003017" class="verse-num">17</span>And he presented the tribute to Eglon king of Moab.

<p class="normal" id="v07021016"> <span class="verse-num">16</span>Then the elders of the congregation said, &ldquo;What shall we do for wives for those who are left, since the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?&rdquo; <span id="v07021017" class="verse-num">17</span>And they said, &ldquo;There must be an inheritance for the survivors of Benjamin, that a tribe not be blotted out from Israel. <span id="v07021018" class="verse-num">18</span>Yet we cannot give them wives from our daughters.&rdquo; For the people of Israel had sworn, &ldquo;Cursed be he who gives a wife to Benjamin.&rdquo; <span id="v07021019" class="verse-num">19</span>So they said, &ldquo;Behold, there is the yearly feast of the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> at Shiloh, which is north of Bethel, on the east of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah.&rdquo; <span id="v07021020" class="verse-num">20</span>And they commanded the people of Benjamin, saying, &ldquo;Go and lie in ambush in the vineyards <span id="v07021021" class="verse-num">21</span>and watch.
