<p id="v09001001" class="heading">The Birth of Samuel</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="book-name"><a href="b09.00.1-Samuel.main.html#a1-samuel-main">1 SAMUEL</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 1 </span>There was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim of the hill country of Ephraim whose name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham, son of Elihu, son of Tohu, son of Zuph, an Ephrathite. <span id="v09001002" class="verse-num">2</span>He had two wives. The name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other, Peninnah. And Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</p>
<p class="normal" id="v09001003"> <span class="verse-num">3</span>Now this man used to go up year by year from his city to worship and to sacrifice to the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> of hosts at Shiloh, where the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests of the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>. <span id="v09001004" class="verse-num">4</span>On the day when Elkanah sacrificed, he would give portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and daughters. <span id="v09001005" class="verse-num">5</span>But to Hannah he gave a double portion, because he loved her, though the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> had closed her womb.<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b09.00.1-Samuel.footnotes.html#f09001005.1" id="b09001005.1">[1]</a></span> <span id="v09001006" class="verse-num">6</span>And her rival used to provoke her grievously to irritate her, because the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> had closed her womb. <span id="v09001007" class="verse-num">7</span>So it went on year by year. As often as she went up to the house of the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>, she used to provoke her. Therefore Hannah wept and would not eat. <span id="v09001008" class="verse-num">8</span>And Elkanah, her husband, said to her, &ldquo;Hannah, why do you weep? And why do you not eat? And why is your heart sad? Am I not more to you than ten sons?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="normal" id="v09001009"> <span class="verse-num">9</span>After they had eaten and drunk in Shiloh, Hannah rose. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat beside the doorpost of the temple of the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>. <span id="v09001010" class="verse-num">10</span>She was deeply distressed and prayed to the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> and wept bitterly. <span id="v09001011" class="verse-num">11</span>And she vowed a vow and said, &ldquo;O L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> of hosts, if you will indeed look on the affliction of your servant and remember me and not forget your servant, but will give to your servant a son, then I will give him to the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> all the days of his life, and no razor shall touch his head.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="normal" id="v09001012"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>As she continued praying before the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>, Eli observed her mouth. <span id="v09001013" class="verse-num">13</span>Hannah was speaking in her heart; only her lips moved, and her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli took her to be a drunken woman. <span id="v09001014" class="verse-num">14</span>And Eli said to her, &ldquo;How long will you go on being drunk? Put your wine away from you.&rdquo; <span id="v09001015" class="verse-num">15</span>But Hannah answered, &ldquo;No, my lord, I am a woman troubled in spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I have been pouring out my soul before the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>. <span id="v09001016" class="verse-num">16</span>Do not regard your servant as a worthless woman, for all along I have been speaking out of my great anxiety and vexation.&rdquo; <span id="v09001017" class="verse-num">17</span>Then Eli answered, &ldquo;Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant your petition that you have made to him.&rdquo; <span id="v09001018" class="verse-num">18</span>And she said, &ldquo;Let your servant find favor in your eyes.&rdquo; Then the woman went her way and ate, and her face was no longer sad.</p>
<p class="normal" id="v09001019"> <span class="verse-num">19</span>They rose early in the morning and worshiped before the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>; then they went back to their house at Ramah.

<p id="v09002011" class="line-space"> <span class="verse-num">11</span>Then Elkanah went home to Ramah.

<p id="v09002012" class="heading">Eli&rsquo;s Worthless Sons</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>Now the sons of Eli were worthless men. They did not know the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>. <span id="v09002013" class="verse-num">13</span>The custom of the priests with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice, the priest&rsquo;s servant would come, while the meat was boiling, with a three-pronged fork in his hand, <span id="v09002014" class="verse-num">14</span>and he would thrust it into the pan or kettle or cauldron or pot. All that the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. This is what they did at Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there. <span id="v09002015" class="verse-num">15</span>Moreover, before the fat was burned, the priest&rsquo;s servant would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, &ldquo;Give meat for the priest to roast, for he will not accept boiled meat from you but only raw.&rdquo; <span id="v09002016" class="verse-num">16</span>And if the man said to him, &ldquo;Let them burn the fat first, and then take as much as you wish,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;No, you must give it now, and if not, I will take it by force.&rdquo; <span id="v09002017" class="verse-num">17</span>Thus the sin of the young men was very great in the sight of the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>, for the men treated the offering of the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> with contempt.</p>
<p class="normal" id="v09002018"> <span class="verse-num">18</span>Samuel was ministering before the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>, a boy clothed with a linen ephod. <span id="v09002019" class="verse-num">19</span>And his mother used to make for him a little robe and take it to him each year when she went up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice. <span id="v09002020" class="verse-num">20</span>Then Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, and say, &ldquo;May the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> give you children by this woman for the petition she asked of the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>.&rdquo; So then they would return to their home.</p>
<p class="normal" id="v09002021"> <span class="verse-num">21</span>Indeed the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> visited Hannah, and she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters. And the boy Samuel grew in the presence of the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>.</p>
<p id="v09002022" class="heading">Eli Rebukes His Sons</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">22</span>Now Eli was very old, and he kept hearing all that his sons were doing to all Israel, and how they lay with the women who were serving at the entrance to the tent of meeting. <span id="v09002023" class="verse-num">23</span>And he said to them, &ldquo;Why do you do such things?
