<p id="v17001010" class="heading">Queen Vashti&rsquo;s Refusal</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">10</span>On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha and Abagtha, Zethar and Carkas, the seven eunuchs who served in the presence of King Ahasuerus, <span id="v17001011" class="verse-num">11</span>to bring Queen Vashti before the king with her royal crown,<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b17.00.Esther.footnotes.html#f17001011.1" id="b17001011.1">[2]</a></span> in order to show the peoples and the princes her beauty, for she was lovely to look at. <span id="v17001012" class="verse-num">12</span>But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king&rsquo;s command delivered by the eunuchs.

<p class="normal" id="v17001013"> <span class="verse-num">13</span>Then the king said to the wise men who knew the times (for this was the king&rsquo;s procedure toward all who were versed in law and judgment, <span id="v17001014" class="verse-num">14</span>the men next to him being Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king&rsquo;s face, and sat first in the kingdom): <span id="v17001015" class="verse-num">15</span>&ldquo;According to the law, what is to be done to Queen Vashti, because she has not performed the command of King Ahasuerus delivered by the eunuchs?&rdquo; <span id="v17001016" class="verse-num">16</span>Then Memucan said in the presence of the king and the officials, &ldquo;Not only against the king has Queen Vashti done wrong, but also against all the officials and all the peoples who are in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus. <span id="v17001017" class="verse-num">17</span>For the queen&rsquo;s behavior will be made known to all women, causing them to look at their husbands with contempt, since they will say, &lsquo;King Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vashti to be brought before him, and she did not come.&rsquo; <span id="v17001018" class="verse-num">18</span>This very day the noble women of Persia and Media who have heard of the queen&rsquo;s behavior will say the same to all the king&rsquo;s officials, and there will be contempt and wrath in plenty. <span id="v17001019" class="verse-num">19</span>If it please the king, let a royal order go out from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes so that it may not be repealed, that Vashti is never again to come before King Ahasuerus. And let the king give her royal position to another who is better than she. <span id="v17001020" class="verse-num">20</span>So when the decree made by the king is proclaimed throughout all his kingdom, for it is vast, all women will give honor to their husbands, high and low alike.&rdquo; <span id="v17001021" class="verse-num">21</span>This advice pleased the king and the princes, and the king did as Memucan proposed. <span id="v17001022" class="verse-num">22</span>He sent letters to all the royal provinces, to every province in its own script and to every people in its own language, that every man be master in his own household and speak according to the language of his people.</p>
<p id="v17002001" class="heading">Esther Chosen Queen</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="book-name"><a href="b17.00.Esther.main.html#esther-main">ESTHER</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 2 </span>After these things, when the anger of King Ahasuerus had abated, he remembered Vashti and what she had done and what had been decreed against her. <span id="v17002002" class="verse-num">2</span>Then the king&rsquo;s young men who attended him said, &ldquo;Let beautiful young virgins be sought out for the king. <span id="v17002003" class="verse-num">3</span>And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom to gather all the beautiful young virgins to the harem in Susa the citadel, under custody of Hegai, the king&rsquo;s eunuch, who is in charge of the women. Let their cosmetics be given them. <span id="v17002004" class="verse-num">4</span>And let the young woman who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti.&rdquo; This pleased the king, and he did so.</p>
<p class="normal" id="v17002005"> <span class="verse-num">5</span>Now there was a Jew in Susa the citadel whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, son of Shimei, son of Kish, a Benjaminite, <span id="v17002006" class="verse-num">6</span>who had been carried away from Jerusalem among the captives carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried away. <span id="v17002007" class="verse-num">7</span>He was bringing up Hadassah, that is Esther, the daughter of his uncle, for she had neither father nor mother. The young woman had a beautiful figure and was lovely to look at, and when her father and her mother died, Mordecai took her as his own daughter. <span id="v17002008" class="verse-num">8</span>So when the king&rsquo;s order and his edict were proclaimed, and when many young women were gathered in Susa the citadel in custody of Hegai, Esther also was taken into the king&rsquo;s palace and put in custody of Hegai, who had charge of the women. <span id="v17002009" class="verse-num">9</span>And the young woman pleased him and won his favor. And he quickly provided her with her cosmetics and her portion of food, and with seven chosen young women from the king&rsquo;s palace, and advanced her and her young women to the best place in the harem. <span id="v17002010" class="verse-num">10</span>Esther had not made known her people or kindred, for Mordecai had commanded her not to make it known. <span id="v17002011" class="verse-num">11</span>And every day Mordecai walked in front of the court of the harem to learn how Esther was and what was happening to her.</p>
<p class="normal" id="v17002012"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>Now when the turn came for each young woman to go in to King Ahasuerus, after being twelve months under the regulations for the women, since this was the regular period of their beautifying, six months with oil of myrrh and six months with spices and ointments for women&mdash; <span id="v17002013" class="verse-num">13</span>when the young woman went in to the king in this way, she was given whatever she desired to take with her from the harem to the king&rsquo;s palace. <span id="v17002014" class="verse-num">14</span>In the evening she would go in, and in the morning she would return to the second harem in custody of Shaashgaz, the king&rsquo;s eunuch, who was in charge of the concubines. She would not go in to the king again, unless the king delighted in her and she was summoned by name.</p>
<p class="normal" id="v17002015"> <span class="verse-num">15</span>When the turn came for Esther the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her as his own daughter, to go in to the king, she asked for nothing except what Hegai the king&rsquo;s eunuch, who had charge of the women, advised. Now Esther was winning favor in the eyes of all who saw her. <span id="v17002016" class="verse-num">16</span>And when Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus, into his royal palace, in the tenth month, which is the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign, <span id="v17002017" class="verse-num">17</span>the king loved Esther more than all the women, and she won grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins, so that he set the royal crown<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b17.00.Esther.footnotes.html#f17002017.1" id="b17002017.1">[1]</a></span> on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti. <span id="v17002018" class="verse-num">18</span>Then the king gave a great feast for all his officials and servants; it was Esther&rsquo;s feast.

<p id="v17002019" class="heading">Mordecai Discovers a Plot</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">19</span>Now when the virgins were gathered together the second time, Mordecai was sitting at the king&rsquo;s gate. <span id="v17002020" class="verse-num">20</span>Esther had not made known her kindred or her people, as Mordecai had commanded her, for Esther obeyed Mordecai just as when she was brought up by him. <span id="v17002021" class="verse-num">21</span>In those days, as Mordecai was sitting at the king&rsquo;s gate, Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king&rsquo;s eunuchs, who guarded the threshold, became angry and sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus. <span id="v17002022" class="verse-num">22</span>And this came to the knowledge of Mordecai, and he told it to Queen Esther, and Esther told the king in the name of Mordecai. <span id="v17002023" class="verse-num">23</span>When the affair was investigated and found to be so, the men were both hanged on the gallows.<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b17.00.Esther.footnotes.html#f17002023.1" id="b17002023.1">[2]</a></span> And it was recorded in the book of the chronicles in the presence of the king.</p>

<p class="no-indent"> <span class="book-name"><a href="b17.00.Esther.main.html#esther-main">ESTHER</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 3 </span>After these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman the Agagite, the son of Hammedatha, and advanced him and set his throne above all the officials who were with him. <span id="v17003002" class="verse-num">2</span>And all the king&rsquo;s servants who were at the king&rsquo;s gate bowed down and paid homage to Haman, for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai did not bow down or pay homage. <span id="v17003003" class="verse-num">3</span>Then the king&rsquo;s servants who were at the king&rsquo;s gate said to Mordecai, &ldquo;Why do you transgress the king&rsquo;s command?&rdquo; <span id="v17003004" class="verse-num">4</span>And when they spoke to him day after day and he would not listen to them, they told Haman, in order to see whether Mordecai&rsquo;s words would stand, for he had told them that he was a Jew. <span id="v17003005" class="verse-num">5</span>And when Haman saw that Mordecai did not bow down or pay homage to him, Haman was filled with fury. <span id="v17003006" class="verse-num">6</span>But he disdained to lay hands on Mordecai alone. So, as they had made known to him the people of Mordecai, Haman sought to destroy all the Jews, the people of Mordecai, throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus.</p>
<p class="normal" id="v17003007"> <span class="verse-num">7</span>In the first month, which is the month of Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur (that is, they cast lots) before Haman day after day; and they cast it month after month till the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar. <span id="v17003008" class="verse-num">8</span>Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus, &ldquo;There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom. Their laws are different from those of every other people, and they do not keep the king&rsquo;s laws, so that it is not to the king&rsquo;s profit to tolerate them. <span id="v17003009" class="verse-num">9</span>If it please the king, let it be decreed that they be destroyed, and I will pay 10,000 talents<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b17.00.Esther.footnotes.html#f17003009.1" id="b17003009.1">[1]</a></span> of silver into the hands of those who have charge of the king&rsquo;s business, that they may put it into the king&rsquo;s treasuries.&rdquo; <span id="v17003010" class="verse-num">10</span>So the king took his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman the Agagite, the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews. <span id="v17003011" class="verse-num">11</span>And the king said to Haman, &ldquo;The money is given to you, the people also, to do with them as it seems good to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="normal" id="v17003012"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>Then the king&rsquo;s scribes were summoned on the thirteenth day of the first month, and an edict, according to all that Haman commanded, was written to the king&rsquo;s satraps and to the governors over all the provinces and to the officials of all the peoples, to every province in its own script and every people in its own language. It was written in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed with the king&rsquo;s signet ring. <span id="v17003013" class="verse-num">13</span>Letters were sent by couriers to all the king&rsquo;s provinces with instruction to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate all Jews, young and old, women and children, in one day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar, and to plunder their goods. <span id="v17003014" class="verse-num">14</span>A copy of the document was to be issued as a decree in every province by proclamation to all the peoples to be ready for that day. <span id="v17003015" class="verse-num">15</span>The couriers went out hurriedly by order of the king, and the decree was issued in Susa the citadel.

<p id="v17004001" class="heading">Esther Agrees to Help the Jews</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="book-name"><a href="b17.00.Esther.main.html#esther-main">ESTHER</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 4 </span>When Mordecai learned all that had been done, Mordecai tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and he cried out with a loud and bitter cry. <span id="v17004002" class="verse-num">2</span>He went up to the entrance of the king&rsquo;s gate, for no one was allowed to enter the king&rsquo;s gate clothed in sackcloth. <span id="v17004003" class="verse-num">3</span>And in every province, wherever the king&rsquo;s command and his decree reached, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting and weeping and lamenting, and many of them lay in sackcloth and ashes.</p>

But as for me, I have not been called to come in to the king these thirty days.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="normal" id="v17004012"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>And they told Mordecai what Esther had said. <span id="v17004013" class="verse-num">13</span>Then Mordecai told them to reply to Esther, &ldquo;Do not think to yourself that in the king&rsquo;s palace you will escape any more than all the other Jews. <span id="v17004014" class="verse-num">14</span>For if you keep silent at this time, relief and deliverance will rise for the Jews from another place, but you and your father&rsquo;s house will perish.
