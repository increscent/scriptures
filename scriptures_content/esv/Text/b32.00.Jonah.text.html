<p id="v32001001" class="heading">Jonah Flees the Presence of the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span></p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="book-name"><a href="b32.00.Jonah.main.html#jonah-main">JONAH</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 1 </span>Now the word of the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> came to Jonah the son of Amittai, saying, <span id="v32001002" class="verse-num">2</span>&ldquo;Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and call out against it, for their evil<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b32.00.Jonah.footnotes.html#f32001002.1" id="b32001002.1">[1]</a></span> has come up before me.&rdquo; <span id="v32001003" class="verse-num">3</span>But Jonah rose to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>. He went down to Joppa and found a ship going to Tarshish. So he paid the fare and went down into it, to go with them to Tarshish, away from the presence of the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>.</p>
<p class="normal" id="v32001004"> <span class="verse-num">4</span>But the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> hurled a great wind upon the sea, and there was a mighty tempest on the sea, so that the ship threatened to break up. <span id="v32001005" class="verse-num">5</span>Then the mariners were afraid, and each cried out to his god. And they hurled the cargo that was in the ship into the sea to lighten it for them. But Jonah had gone down into the inner part of the ship and had lain down and was fast asleep. <span id="v32001006" class="verse-num">6</span>So the captain came and said to him, &ldquo;What do you mean, you sleeper? Arise, call out to your god! Perhaps the god will give a thought to us, that we may not perish.&rdquo;</p>

What is your occupation? And where do you come from? What is your country? And of what people are you?&rdquo; <span id="v32001009" class="verse-num">9</span>And he said to them, &ldquo;I am a Hebrew, and I fear the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land.&rdquo; <span id="v32001010" class="verse-num">10</span>Then the men were exceedingly afraid and said to him, &ldquo;What is this that you have done!&rdquo; For the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>, because he had told them.</p>
<p class="normal" id="v32001011"> <span class="verse-num">11</span>Then they said to him, &ldquo;What shall we do to you, that the sea may quiet down for us?&rdquo; For the sea grew more and more tempestuous. <span id="v32001012" class="verse-num">12</span>He said to them, &ldquo;Pick me up and hurl me into the sea; then the sea will quiet down for you, for I know it is because of me that this great tempest has come upon you.&rdquo; <span id="v32001013" class="verse-num">13</span>Nevertheless, the men rowed hard<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b32.00.Jonah.footnotes.html#f32001013.1" id="b32001013.1">[2]</a></span> to get back to dry land, but they could not, for the sea grew more and more tempestuous against them. <span id="v32001014" class="verse-num">14</span>Therefore they called out to the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>, &ldquo;O L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>, let us not perish for this man&rsquo;s life, and lay not on us innocent blood, for you, O L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>, have done as it pleased you.&rdquo; <span id="v32001015" class="verse-num">15</span>So they picked up Jonah and hurled him into the sea, and the sea ceased from its raging. <span id="v32001016" class="verse-num">16</span>Then the men feared the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> exceedingly, and they offered a sacrifice to the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> and made vows.</p>
