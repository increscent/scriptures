<p id="v37001001" class="heading">The Command to Rebuild the Temple</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="book-name"><a href="b37.00.Haggai.main.html#haggai-main">HAGGAI</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 1 </span>In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, on the first day of the month, the word of the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> came by the hand of Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest: <span id="v37001002" class="verse-num">2</span>&ldquo;Thus says the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> of hosts: These people say the time has not yet come to rebuild the house of the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>.&rdquo; <span id="v37001003" class="verse-num">3</span>Then the word of the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> came by the hand of Haggai the prophet, <span id="v37001004" class="verse-num">4</span>&ldquo;Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your paneled houses, while this house lies in ruins? <span id="v37001005" class="verse-num">5</span>Now, therefore, thus says the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> of hosts: Consider your ways. <span id="v37001006" class="verse-num">6</span>You have sown much, and harvested little. You eat, but you never have enough; you drink, but you never have your fill. You clothe yourselves, but no one is warm. And he who earns wages does so to put them into a bag with holes.</p>
<p class="normal" id="v37001007"> <span class="verse-num">7</span>&ldquo;Thus says the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> of hosts: Consider your ways. <span id="v37001008" class="verse-num">8</span>Go up to the hills and bring wood and build the house, that I may take pleasure in it and that I may be glorified, says the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>. <span id="v37001009" class="verse-num">9</span>You looked for much, and behold, it came to little. And when you brought it home, I blew it away. Why? declares the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> of hosts. Because of my house that lies in ruins, while each of you busies himself with his own house. <span id="v37001010" class="verse-num">10</span>Therefore the heavens above you have withheld the dew, and the earth has withheld its produce. <span id="v37001011" class="verse-num">11</span>And I have called for a drought on the land and the hills, on the grain, the new wine, the oil, on what the ground brings forth, on man and beast, and on all their labors.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="v37001012" class="heading">The People Obey the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span></p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> their God had sent him. And the people feared the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>. <span id="v37001013" class="verse-num">13</span>Then Haggai, the messenger of the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>, spoke to the people with the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>&rsquo;s message, &ldquo;I am with you, declares the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>.&rdquo; <span id="v37001014" class="verse-num">14</span>And the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people. And they came and worked on the house of the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> of hosts, their God, <span id="v37001015" class="verse-num">15</span>on the twenty-fourth day of the month, in the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.</p>

Be strong, O Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest. Be strong, all you people of the land, declares the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>. Work, for I am with you, declares the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> of hosts, <span id="v37002005" class="verse-num">5</span>according to the covenant that I made with you when you came out of Egypt. My Spirit remains in your midst. Fear not. <span id="v37002006" class="verse-num">6</span>For thus says the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> of hosts: Yet once more, in a little while, I will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land. <span id="v37002007" class="verse-num">7</span>And I will shake all nations, so that the treasures of all nations shall come in, and I will fill this house with glory, says the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> of hosts. <span id="v37002008" class="verse-num">8</span>The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, declares the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> of hosts. <span id="v37002009" class="verse-num">9</span>The latter glory of this house shall be greater than the former, says the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> of hosts.
