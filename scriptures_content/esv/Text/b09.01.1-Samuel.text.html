For you showed kindness to all the people of Israel when they came up out of Egypt.&rdquo; So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites. <span id="v09015007" class="verse-num">7</span>And Saul defeated the Amalekites from Havilah as far as Shur, which is east of Egypt. <span id="v09015008" class="verse-num">8</span>And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive and devoted to destruction all the people with the edge of the sword. <span id="v09015009" class="verse-num">9</span>But Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the sheep and of the oxen and of the fattened calves<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b09.00.1-Samuel.footnotes.html#f09015009.1" id="b09015009.1">[2]</a></span> and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them.

<p class="normal" id="v09015010"> <span class="verse-num">10</span>The word of the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> came to Samuel: <span id="v09015011" class="verse-num">11</span>&ldquo;I regret<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b09.00.1-Samuel.footnotes.html#f09015011.1" id="b09015011.1">[3]</a></span> that I have made Saul king, for he has turned back from following me and has not performed my commandments.&rdquo; And Samuel was angry, and he cried to the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> all night. <span id="v09015012" class="verse-num">12</span>And Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning. And it was told Samuel, &ldquo;Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he set up a monument for himself and turned and passed on and went down to Gilgal.&rdquo; <span id="v09015013" class="verse-num">13</span>And Samuel came to Saul, and Saul said to him, &ldquo;Blessed be you to the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>.

<p class="normal" id="v09015017"> <span class="verse-num">17</span>And Samuel said, &ldquo;Though you are little in your own eyes, are you not the head of the tribes of Israel?

Why did you pounce on the spoil and do what was evil in the sight of the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>?&rdquo; <span id="v09015020" class="verse-num">20</span>And Saul said to Samuel, &ldquo;I have obeyed the voice of the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>.

<p class="line-indent">and to listen than the fat of rams.</p>
<p class="line"><span id="v09015023" class="verse-num">23</span> For rebellion is as the sin of divination,</p>

<p class="line">Because you have rejected the word of the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>,</p>
<p class="line-indent">he has also rejected you from being king.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="v09015024" class="line-space"> <span class="verse-num">24</span>Saul said to Samuel, &ldquo;I have sinned, for I have transgressed the commandment of the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> and your words, because I feared the people and obeyed their voice. <span id="v09015025" class="verse-num">25</span>Now therefore, please pardon my sin and return with me that I may bow before the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>.&rdquo; <span id="v09015026" class="verse-num">26</span>And Samuel said to Saul, &ldquo;I will not return with you.

And the commanders of the Philistines said to him, &ldquo;Send the man back, that he may return to the place to which you have assigned him. He shall not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he become an adversary to us. For how could this fellow reconcile himself to his lord?

<p id="v09029006" class="line-space"> <span class="verse-num">6</span>Then Achish called David and said to him, &ldquo;As the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> lives, you have been honest, and to me it seems right that you should march out and in with me in the campaign. For I have found nothing wrong in you from the day of your coming to me to this day. Nevertheless, the lords do not approve of you. <span id="v09029007" class="verse-num">7</span>So go back now; and go peaceably, that you may not displease the lords of the Philistines.&rdquo; <span id="v09029008" class="verse-num">8</span>And David said to Achish, &ldquo;But what have I done? What have you found in your servant from the day I entered your service until now, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?&rdquo; <span id="v09029009" class="verse-num">9</span>And Achish answered David and said, &ldquo;I know that you are as blameless in my sight as an angel of God. Nevertheless, the commanders of the Philistines have said, &lsquo;He shall not go up with us to the battle.&rsquo; <span id="v09029010" class="verse-num">10</span>Now then rise early in the morning with the servants of your lord who came with you, and start early in the morning, and depart as soon as you have light.&rdquo; <span id="v09029011" class="verse-num">11</span>So David set out with his men early in the morning to return to the land of the Philistines.

<p class="normal" id="v09030011"> <span class="verse-num">11</span>They found an Egyptian in the open country and brought him to David. And they gave him bread and he ate.

<p id="v09030016" class="heading">David Defeats the Amalekites</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">16</span>And when he had taken him down, behold, they were spread abroad over all the land, eating and drinking and dancing, because of all the great spoil they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah. <span id="v09030017" class="verse-num">17</span>And David struck them down from twilight until the evening of the next day, and not a man of them escaped, except four hundred young men, who mounted camels and fled. <span id="v09030018" class="verse-num">18</span>David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken, and David rescued his two wives. <span id="v09030019" class="verse-num">19</span>Nothing was missing, whether small or great, sons or daughters, spoil or anything that had been taken.
