<h2>2 Corinthians</h2>
<p id="v47001001" class="heading">Greeting</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="book-name"><a href="b47.00.2-Corinthians.main.html#a2-corinthians-main">2 CORINTHIANS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 1 </span>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,</p>
<p>To the church of God that is at Corinth, with all the saints who are in the whole of Achaia:</p>
<p class="normal" id="v47001002"> <span class="verse-num">2</span>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p id="v47001003" class="heading">God of All Comfort</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">3</span>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort, <span id="v47001004" class="verse-num">4</span>who comforts us in all our affliction, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God. <span id="v47001005" class="verse-num">5</span>For as we share abundantly in Christ&rsquo;s sufferings, so through Christ we share abundantly in comfort too.<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b47.00.2-Corinthians.footnotes.html#f47001005.1" id="b47001005.1">[1]</a></span> <span id="v47001006" class="verse-num">6</span>If we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; and if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which you experience when you patiently endure the same sufferings that we suffer. <span id="v47001007" class="verse-num">7</span>Our hope for you is unshaken, for we know that as you share in our sufferings, you will also share in our comfort.</p>
<p class="normal" id="v47001008"> <span class="verse-num">8</span>For we do not want you to be unaware, brothers,<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b47.00.2-Corinthians.footnotes.html#f47001008.1" id="b47001008.1">[2]</a></span> of the affliction we experienced in Asia. For we were so utterly burdened beyond our strength that we despaired of life itself. <span id="v47001009" class="verse-num">9</span>Indeed, we felt that we had received the sentence of death. But that was to make us rely not on ourselves but on God who raises the dead. <span id="v47001010" class="verse-num">10</span>He delivered us from such a deadly peril, and he will deliver us. On him we have set our hope that he will deliver us again. <span id="v47001011" class="verse-num">11</span>You also must help us by prayer, so that many will give thanks on our behalf for the blessing granted us through the prayers of many.</p>
<p id="v47001012" class="heading">Paul&rsquo;s Change of Plans</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>For our boast is this, the testimony of our conscience, that we behaved in the world with simplicity<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b47.00.2-Corinthians.footnotes.html#f47001012.1" id="b47001012.1">[3]</a></span> and godly sincerity, not by earthly wisdom but by the grace of God, and supremely so toward you. <span id="v47001013" class="verse-num">13</span>For we are not writing to you anything other than what you read and understand and I hope you will fully understand&mdash; <span id="v47001014" class="verse-num">14</span>just as you did partially understand us&mdash;that on the day of our Lord Jesus you will boast of us as we will boast of you.</p>
<p class="normal" id="v47001015"> <span class="verse-num">15</span>Because I was sure of this, I wanted to come to you first, so that you might have a second experience of grace. <span id="v47001016" class="verse-num">16</span>I wanted to visit you on my way to Macedonia, and to come back to you from Macedonia and have you send me on my way to Judea. <span id="v47001017" class="verse-num">17</span>Was I vacillating when I wanted to do this? Do I make my plans according to the flesh, ready to say &ldquo;Yes, yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;No, no&rdquo; at the same time? <span id="v47001018" class="verse-num">18</span>As surely as God is faithful, our word to you has not been Yes and No. <span id="v47001019" class="verse-num">19</span>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, whom we proclaimed among you, Silvanus and Timothy and I, was not Yes and No, but in him it is always Yes. <span id="v47001020" class="verse-num">20</span>For all the promises of God find their Yes in him. That is why it is through him that we utter our Amen to God for his glory. <span id="v47001021" class="verse-num">21</span>And it is God who establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, <span id="v47001022" class="verse-num">22</span>and who has also put his seal on us and given us his Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee.<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b47.00.2-Corinthians.footnotes.html#f47001022.1" id="b47001022.1">[4]</a></span></p>
<p class="normal" id="v47001023"> <span class="verse-num">23</span>But I call God to witness against me&mdash;it was to spare you that I refrained from coming again to Corinth. <span id="v47001024" class="verse-num">24</span>Not that we lord it over your faith, but we work with you for your joy, for you stand firm in your faith.</p>
<p class="normal" id="v47002001"> <span class="book-name"><a href="b47.00.2-Corinthians.main.html#a2-corinthians-main">2 CORINTHIANS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 2 </span>For I made up my mind not to make another painful visit to you. <span id="v47002002" class="verse-num">2</span>For if I cause you pain, who is there to make me glad but the one whom I have pained? <span id="v47002003" class="verse-num">3</span>And I wrote as I did, so that when I came I might not suffer pain from those who should have made me rejoice, for I felt sure of all of you, that my joy would be the joy of you all. <span id="v47002004" class="verse-num">4</span>For I wrote to you out of much affliction and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to cause you pain but to let you know the abundant love that I have for you.</p>
<p id="v47002005" class="heading">Forgive the Sinner</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">5</span>Now if anyone has caused pain, he has caused it not to me, but in some measure&mdash;not to put it too severely&mdash;to all of you. <span id="v47002006" class="verse-num">6</span>For such a one, this punishment by the majority is enough, <span id="v47002007" class="verse-num">7</span>so you should rather turn to forgive and comfort him, or he may be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow. <span id="v47002008" class="verse-num">8</span>So I beg you to reaffirm your love for him. <span id="v47002009" class="verse-num">9</span>For this is why I wrote, that I might test you and know whether you are obedient in everything. <span id="v47002010" class="verse-num">10</span>Anyone whom you forgive, I also forgive. Indeed, what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, has been for your sake in the presence of Christ, <span id="v47002011" class="verse-num">11</span>so that we would not be outwitted by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his designs.</p>
<p id="v47002012" class="heading">Triumph in Christ</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>When I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ, even though a door was opened for me in the Lord, <span id="v47002013" class="verse-num">13</span>my spirit was not at rest because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I took leave of them and went on to Macedonia.</p>
<p class="normal" id="v47002014"> <span class="verse-num">14</span>But thanks be to God, who in Christ always leads us in triumphal procession, and through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of him everywhere. <span id="v47002015" class="verse-num">15</span>For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing, <span id="v47002016" class="verse-num">16</span>to one a fragrance from death to death, to the other a fragrance from life to life. Who is sufficient for these things? <span id="v47002017" class="verse-num">17</span>For we are not, like so many, peddlers of God&rsquo;s word, but as men of sincerity, as commissioned by God, in the sight of God we speak in Christ.</p>
<p id="v47003001" class="heading">Ministers of the New Covenant</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="book-name"><a href="b47.00.2-Corinthians.main.html#a2-corinthians-main">2 CORINTHIANS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 3 </span>Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, as some do, letters of recommendation to you, or from you? <span id="v47003002" class="verse-num">2</span>You yourselves are our letter of recommendation, written on our<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b47.00.2-Corinthians.footnotes.html#f47003002.1" id="b47003002.1">[1]</a></span> hearts, to be known and read by all. <span id="v47003003" class="verse-num">3</span>And you show that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b47.00.2-Corinthians.footnotes.html#f47003003.1" id="b47003003.1">[2]</a></span></p>
<p class="normal" id="v47003004"> <span class="verse-num">4</span>Such is the confidence that we have through Christ toward God. <span id="v47003005" class="verse-num">5</span>Not that we are sufficient in ourselves to claim anything as coming from us, but our sufficiency is from God, <span id="v47003006" class="verse-num">6</span>who has made us sufficient to be ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.</p>
<p class="normal" id="v47003007"> <span class="verse-num">7</span>Now if the ministry of death, carved in letters on stone, came with such glory that the Israelites could not gaze at Moses&rsquo; face because of its glory, which was being brought to an end, <span id="v47003008" class="verse-num">8</span>will not the ministry of the Spirit have even more glory? <span id="v47003009" class="verse-num">9</span>For if there was glory in the ministry of condemnation, the ministry of righteousness must far exceed it in glory. <span id="v47003010" class="verse-num">10</span>Indeed, in this case, what once had glory has come to have no glory at all, because of the glory that surpasses it. <span id="v47003011" class="verse-num">11</span>For if what was being brought to an end came with glory, much more will what is permanent have glory.</p>
<p class="normal" id="v47003012"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>Since we have such a hope, we are very bold, <span id="v47003013" class="verse-num">13</span>not like Moses, who would put a veil over his face so that the Israelites might not gaze at the outcome of what was being brought to an end. <span id="v47003014" class="verse-num">14</span>But their minds were hardened. For to this day, when they read the old covenant, that same veil remains unlifted, because only through Christ is it taken away. <span id="v47003015" class="verse-num">15</span>Yes, to this day whenever Moses is read a veil lies over their hearts. <span id="v47003016" class="verse-num">16</span>But when one<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b47.00.2-Corinthians.footnotes.html#f47003016.1" id="b47003016.1">[3]</a></span> turns to the Lord, the veil is removed. <span id="v47003017" class="verse-num">17</span>Now the Lord<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b47.00.2-Corinthians.footnotes.html#f47003017.1" id="b47003017.1">[4]</a></span> is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. <span id="v47003018" class="verse-num">18</span>And we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord,<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b47.00.2-Corinthians.footnotes.html#f47003018.1" id="b47003018.1">[5]</a></span> are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another.

<p id="v47004007" class="heading">Treasure in Jars of Clay</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">7</span>But we have this treasure in jars of clay, to show that the surpassing power belongs to God and not to us. <span id="v47004008" class="verse-num">8</span>We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not driven to despair; <span id="v47004009" class="verse-num">9</span>persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed; <span id="v47004010" class="verse-num">10</span>always carrying in the body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our bodies. <span id="v47004011" class="verse-num">11</span>For we who live are always being given over to death for Jesus&rsquo; sake, so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh. <span id="v47004012" class="verse-num">12</span>So death is at work in us, but life in you.</p>
<p class="normal" id="v47004013"> <span class="verse-num">13</span>Since we have the same spirit of faith according to what has been written, &ldquo;I believed, and so I spoke,&rdquo; we also believe, and so we also speak, <span id="v47004014" class="verse-num">14</span>knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and bring us with you into his presence. <span id="v47004015" class="verse-num">15</span>For it is all for your sake, so that as grace extends to more and more people it may increase thanksgiving, to the glory of God.</p>
<p class="normal" id="v47004016"> <span class="verse-num">16</span>So we do not lose heart. Though our outer self<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b47.00.2-Corinthians.footnotes.html#f47004016.1" id="b47004016.1">[4]</a></span> is wasting away, our inner self is being renewed day by day. <span id="v47004017" class="verse-num">17</span>For this light momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison, <span id="v47004018" class="verse-num">18</span>as we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen. For the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal.</p>
<p id="v47005001" class="heading">Our Heavenly Dwelling</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="book-name"><a href="b47.00.2-Corinthians.main.html#a2-corinthians-main">2 CORINTHIANS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 5 </span>For we know that if the tent that is our earthly home is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. <span id="v47005002" class="verse-num">2</span>For in this tent we groan, longing to put on our heavenly dwelling, <span id="v47005003" class="verse-num">3</span>if indeed by putting it on<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b47.00.2-Corinthians.footnotes.html#f47005003.1" id="b47005003.1">[1]</a></span> we may not be found naked. <span id="v47005004" class="verse-num">4</span>For while we are still in this tent, we groan, being burdened&mdash;not that we would be unclothed, but that we would be further clothed, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life. <span id="v47005005" class="verse-num">5</span>He who has prepared us for this very thing is God, who has given us the Spirit as a guarantee.</p>

<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">11</span>Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade others.

For children are not obligated to save up for their parents, but parents for their children. <span id="v47012015" class="verse-num">15</span>I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more, am I to be loved less? <span id="v47012016" class="verse-num">16</span>But granting that I myself did not burden you, I was crafty, you say, and got the better of you by deceit. <span id="v47012017" class="verse-num">17</span>Did I take advantage of you through any of those whom I sent to you? <span id="v47012018" class="verse-num">18</span>I urged Titus to go, and sent the brother with him. Did Titus take advantage of you? Did we not act in the same spirit? Did we not take the same steps?</p>
<p class="normal" id="v47012019"> <span class="verse-num">19</span>Have you been thinking all along that we have been defending ourselves to you? It is in the sight of God that we have been speaking in Christ, and all for your upbuilding, beloved. <span id="v47012020" class="verse-num">20</span>For I fear that perhaps when I come I may find you not as I wish, and that you may find me not as you wish&mdash;that perhaps there may be quarreling, jealousy, anger, hostility, slander, gossip, conceit, and disorder. <span id="v47012021" class="verse-num">21</span>I fear that when I come again my God may humble me before you, and I may have to mourn over many of those who sinned earlier and have not repented of the impurity, sexual immorality, and sensuality that they have practiced.</p>
<p id="v47013001" class="heading">Final Warnings</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="book-name"><a href="b47.00.2-Corinthians.main.html#a2-corinthians-main">2 CORINTHIANS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 13 </span>This is the third time I am coming to you. Every charge must be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses. <span id="v47013002" class="verse-num">2</span>I warned those who sinned before and all the others, and I warn them now while absent, as I did when present on my second visit, that if I come again I will not spare them&mdash; <span id="v47013003" class="verse-num">3</span>since you seek proof that Christ is speaking in me. He is not weak in dealing with you, but is powerful among you. <span id="v47013004" class="verse-num">4</span>For he was crucified in weakness, but lives by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but in dealing with you we will live with him by the power of God.</p>
<p class="normal" id="v47013005"> <span class="verse-num">5</span>Examine yourselves, to see whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Or do you not realize this about yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you?&mdash;unless indeed you fail to meet the test! <span id="v47013006" class="verse-num">6</span>I hope you will find out that we have not failed the test. <span id="v47013007" class="verse-num">7</span>But we pray to God that you may not do wrong&mdash;not that we may appear to have met the test, but that you may do what is right, though we may seem to have failed. <span id="v47013008" class="verse-num">8</span>For we cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the truth. <span id="v47013009" class="verse-num">9</span>For we are glad when we are weak and you are strong. Your restoration is what we pray for. <span id="v47013010" class="verse-num">10</span>For this reason I write these things while I am away from you, that when I come I may not have to be severe in my use of the authority that the Lord has given me for building up and not for tearing down.</p>
