<p id="v05001001" class="heading">The Command to Leave Horeb</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="book-name"><a href="b05.00.Deuteronomy.main.html#deuteronomy-main">DEUTERONOMY</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 1 </span>These are the words that Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah opposite Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab. <span id="v05001002" class="verse-num">2</span>It is eleven days&rsquo; journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir to Kadesh-barnea. <span id="v05001003" class="verse-num">3</span>In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses spoke to the people of Israel according to all that the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> had given him in commandment to them, <span id="v05001004" class="verse-num">4</span>after he had defeated Sihon the king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth and in Edrei. <span id="v05001005" class="verse-num">5</span>Beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, Moses undertook to explain this law, saying, <span id="v05001006" class="verse-num">6</span>&ldquo;The L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> our God said to us in Horeb, &lsquo;You have stayed long enough at this mountain. <span id="v05001007" class="verse-num">7</span>Turn and take your journey, and go to the hill country of the Amorites and to all their neighbors in the Arabah, in the hill country and in the lowland and in the Negeb and by the seacoast, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates. <span id="v05001008" class="verse-num">8</span>See, I have set the land before you. Go in and take possession of the land that the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give to them and to their offspring after them.&rsquo;</p>
<p id="v05001009" class="heading">Leaders Appointed</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">9</span>&ldquo;At that time I said to you, &lsquo;I am not able to bear you by myself. <span id="v05001010" class="verse-num">10</span>The L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> your God has multiplied you, and behold, you are today as numerous as the stars of heaven. <span id="v05001011" class="verse-num">11</span>May the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times as many as you are and bless you, as he has promised you! <span id="v05001012" class="verse-num">12</span>How can I bear by myself the weight and burden of you and your strife? <span id="v05001013" class="verse-num">13</span>Choose for your tribes wise, understanding, and experienced men, and I will appoint them as your heads.&rsquo; <span id="v05001014" class="verse-num">14</span>And you answered me, &lsquo;The thing that you have spoken is good for us to do.&rsquo; <span id="v05001015" class="verse-num">15</span>So I took the heads of your tribes, wise and experienced men, and set them as heads over you, commanders of thousands, commanders of hundreds, commanders of fifties, commanders of tens, and officers, throughout your tribes. <span id="v05001016" class="verse-num">16</span>And I charged your judges at that time, &lsquo;Hear the cases between your brothers, and judge righteously between a man and his brother or the alien who is with him. <span id="v05001017" class="verse-num">17</span>You shall not be partial in judgment. You shall hear the small and the great alike. You shall not be intimidated by anyone, for the judgment is God&rsquo;s. And the case that is too hard for you, you shall bring to me, and I will hear it.&rsquo; <span id="v05001018" class="verse-num">18</span>And I commanded you at that time all the things that you should do.</p>
<p id="v05001019" class="heading">Israel&rsquo;s Refusal to Enter the Land</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">19</span>&ldquo;Then we set out from Horeb and went through all that great and terrifying wilderness that you saw, on the way to the hill country of the Amorites, as the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> our God commanded us. And we came to Kadesh-barnea. <span id="v05001020" class="verse-num">20</span>And I said to you, &lsquo;You have come to the hill country of the Amorites, which the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> our God is giving us. <span id="v05001021" class="verse-num">21</span>See, the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> your God has set the land before you.

Do not fear or be dismayed.&rsquo; <span id="v05001022" class="verse-num">22</span>Then all of you came near me and said, &lsquo;Let us send men before us, that they may explore the land for us and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up and the cities into which we shall come.&rsquo; <span id="v05001023" class="verse-num">23</span>The thing seemed good to me, and I took twelve men from you, one man from each tribe. <span id="v05001024" class="verse-num">24</span>And they turned and went up into the hill country, and came to the Valley of Eshcol and spied it out. <span id="v05001025" class="verse-num">25</span>And they took in their hands some of the fruit of the land and brought it down to us, and brought us word again and said, &lsquo;It is a good land that the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> our God is giving us.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="normal" id="v05001026"> <span class="verse-num">26</span>&ldquo;Yet you would not go up, but rebelled against the command of the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> your God. <span id="v05001027" class="verse-num">27</span>And you murmured in your tents and said, &lsquo;Because the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> hated us he has brought us out of the land of Egypt, to give us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us. <span id="v05001028" class="verse-num">28</span>Where are we going up? Our brothers have made our hearts melt, saying, &ldquo;The people are greater and taller than we. The cities are great and fortified up to heaven. And besides, we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.&rdquo;&rsquo; <span id="v05001029" class="verse-num">29</span>Then I said to you, &lsquo;Do not be in dread or afraid of them. <span id="v05001030" class="verse-num">30</span>The L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> your God who goes before you will himself fight for you, just as he did for you in Egypt before your eyes, <span id="v05001031" class="verse-num">31</span>and in the wilderness, where you have seen how the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> your God carried you, as a man carries his son, all the way that you went until you came to this place.&rsquo; <span id="v05001032" class="verse-num">32</span>Yet in spite of this word you did not believe the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> your God, <span id="v05001033" class="verse-num">33</span>who went before you in the way to seek you out a place to pitch your tents, in fire by night and in the cloud by day, to show you by what way you should go.</p>
<p id="v05001034" class="heading">The Penalty for Israel&rsquo;s Rebellion</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">34</span>&ldquo;And the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> heard your words and was angered, and he swore, <span id="v05001035" class="verse-num">35</span>&lsquo;Not one of these men of this evil generation shall see the good land that I swore to give to your fathers, <span id="v05001036" class="verse-num">36</span>except Caleb the son of Jephunneh. He shall see it, and to him and to his children I will give the land on which he has trodden, because he has wholly followed the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>!&rsquo; <span id="v05001037" class="verse-num">37</span>Even with me the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> was angry on your account and said, &lsquo;You also shall not go in there. <span id="v05001038" class="verse-num">38</span>Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, he shall enter. Encourage him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it. <span id="v05001039" class="verse-num">39</span>And as for your little ones, who you said would become a prey, and your children, who today have no knowledge of good or evil, they shall go in there. And to them I will give it, and they shall possess it. <span id="v05001040" class="verse-num">40</span>But as for you, turn, and journey into the wilderness in the direction of the Red Sea.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="normal" id="v05001041"> <span class="verse-num">41</span>&ldquo;Then you answered me, &lsquo;We have sinned against the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>. We ourselves will go up and fight, just as the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> our God commanded us.&rsquo; And every one of you fastened on his weapons of war and thought it easy to go up into the hill country. <span id="v05001042" class="verse-num">42</span>And the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> said to me, &lsquo;Say to them, Do not go up or fight, for I am not in your midst, lest you be defeated before your enemies.&rsquo; <span id="v05001043" class="verse-num">43</span>So I spoke to you, and you would not listen; but you rebelled against the command of the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> and presumptuously went up into the hill country. <span id="v05001044" class="verse-num">44</span>Then the Amorites who lived in that hill country came out against you and chased you as bees do and beat you down in Seir as far as Hormah. <span id="v05001045" class="verse-num">45</span>And you returned and wept before the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>, but the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> did not listen to your voice or give ear to you. <span id="v05001046" class="verse-num">46</span>So you remained at Kadesh many days, the days that you remained there.</p>
<p id="v05002001" class="heading">The Wilderness Years</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="book-name"><a href="b05.00.Deuteronomy.main.html#deuteronomy-main">DEUTERONOMY</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 2 </span>&ldquo;Then we turned and journeyed into the wilderness in the direction of the Red Sea, as the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> told me. And for many days we traveled around Mount Seir. <span id="v05002002" class="verse-num">2</span>Then the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> said to me, <span id="v05002003" class="verse-num">3</span>&lsquo;You have been traveling around this mountain country long enough. Turn northward <span id="v05002004" class="verse-num">4</span>and command the people, &ldquo;You are about to pass through the territory of your brothers, the people of Esau, who live in Seir; and they will be afraid of you. So be very careful. <span id="v05002005" class="verse-num">5</span>Do not contend with them, for I will not give you any of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on, because I have given Mount Seir to Esau as a possession. <span id="v05002006" class="verse-num">6</span>You shall purchase food from them with money, that you may eat, and you shall also buy water from them with money, that you may drink. <span id="v05002007" class="verse-num">7</span>For the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands.

You have lacked nothing.&rdquo;&rsquo; <span id="v05002008" class="verse-num">8</span>So we went on, away from our brothers, the people of Esau, who live in Seir, away from the Arabah road from Elath and Ezion-geber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we turned and went in the direction of the wilderness of Moab. <span id="v05002009" class="verse-num">9</span>And the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> said to me, &lsquo;Do not harass Moab or contend with them in battle, for I will not give you any of their land for a possession, because I have given Ar to the people of Lot for a possession.&rsquo; <span id="v05002010" class="verse-num">10</span>(The Emim formerly lived there, a people great and many, and tall as the Anakim. <span id="v05002011" class="verse-num">11</span>Like the Anakim they are also counted as Rephaim, but the Moabites call them Emim. <span id="v05002012" class="verse-num">12</span>The Horites also lived in Seir formerly, but the people of Esau dispossessed them and destroyed them from before them and settled in their place, as Israel did to the land of their possession, which the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> gave to them.) <span id="v05002013" class="verse-num">13</span>&lsquo;Now rise up and go over the brook Zered.&rsquo; So we went over the brook Zered. <span id="v05002014" class="verse-num">14</span>And the time from our leaving Kadesh-barnea until we crossed the brook Zered was thirty-eight years, until the entire generation, that is, the men of war, had perished from the camp, as the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> had sworn to them. <span id="v05002015" class="verse-num">15</span>For indeed the hand of the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> was against them, to destroy them from the camp, until they had perished.</p>
<p class="normal" id="v05002016"> <span class="verse-num">16</span>&ldquo;So as soon as all the men of war had perished and were dead from among the people, <span id="v05002017" class="verse-num">17</span>the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> said to me, <span id="v05002018" class="verse-num">18</span>&lsquo;Today you are to cross the border of Moab at Ar. <span id="v05002019" class="verse-num">19</span>And when you approach the territory of the people of Ammon, do not harass them or contend with them, for I will not give you any of the land of the people of Ammon as a possession, because I have given it to the sons of Lot for a possession.&rsquo; <span id="v05002020" class="verse-num">20</span>(It is also counted as a land of Rephaim.

<p id="v05002026" class="heading">The Defeat of King Sihon</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">26</span>&ldquo;So I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon the king of Heshbon, with words of peace, saying, <span id="v05002027" class="verse-num">27</span>&lsquo;Let me pass through your land.
