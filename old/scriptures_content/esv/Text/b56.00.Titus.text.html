These things are excellent and profitable for people. <span id="v56003009" class="verse-num">9</span>But avoid foolish controversies, genealogies, dissensions, and quarrels about the law, for they are unprofitable and worthless. <span id="v56003010" class="verse-num">10</span>As for a person who stirs up division, after warning him once and then twice, have nothing more to do with him, <span id="v56003011" class="verse-num">11</span>knowing that such a person is warped and sinful; he is self-condemned.</p>
