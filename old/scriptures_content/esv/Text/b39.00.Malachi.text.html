You bring what has been taken by violence or is lame or sick, and this you bring as your offering! Shall I accept that from your hand? says the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>. <span id="v39001014" class="verse-num">14</span>Cursed be the cheat who has a male in his flock, and vows it, and yet sacrifices to the Lord what is blemished.
