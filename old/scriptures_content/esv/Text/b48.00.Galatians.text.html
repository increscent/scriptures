<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">15</span>To give a human example, brothers:<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b48.00.Galatians.footnotes.html#f48003015.1" id="b48003015.1">[6]</a></span> even with a man-made covenant, no one annuls it or adds to it once it has been ratified. <span id="v48003016" class="verse-num">16</span>Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring.

<p class="normal" id="v48003019"> <span class="verse-num">19</span>Why then the law? It was added because of transgressions, until the offspring should come to whom the promise had been made, and it was put in place through angels by an intermediary. <span id="v48003020" class="verse-num">20</span>Now an intermediary implies more than one, but God is one.</p>
<p class="normal" id="v48003021"> <span class="verse-num">21</span>Is the law then contrary to the promises of God? Certainly not! For if a law had been given that could give life, then righteousness would indeed be by the law. <span id="v48003022" class="verse-num">22</span>But the Scripture imprisoned everything under sin, so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.</p>
<p class="normal" id="v48003023"> <span class="verse-num">23</span>Now before faith came, we were held captive under the law, imprisoned until the coming faith would be revealed. <span id="v48003024" class="verse-num">24</span>So then, the law was our guardian until Christ came, in order that we might be justified by faith. <span id="v48003025" class="verse-num">25</span>But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian, <span id="v48003026" class="verse-num">26</span>for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith. <span id="v48003027" class="verse-num">27</span>For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. <span id="v48003028" class="verse-num">28</span>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b48.00.Galatians.footnotes.html#f48003028.1" id="b48003028.1">[7]</a></span> nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. <span id="v48003029" class="verse-num">29</span>And if you are Christ&rsquo;s, then you are Abraham&rsquo;s offspring, heirs according to promise.</p>
