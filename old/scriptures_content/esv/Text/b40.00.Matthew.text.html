<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">34</span>All these things Jesus said to the crowds in parables; indeed, he said nothing to them without a parable. <span id="v40013035" class="verse-num">35</span>This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet:<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b40.00.Matthew.footnotes.html#f40013035.1" id="b40013035.1">[5]</a></span></p>
