<p id="v11011001" class="heading">Solomon Turns from the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span></p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="book-name"><a href="b11.00.1-Kings.main.html#a1-kings-main">1 KINGS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 11 </span>Now King Solomon loved many foreign women, along with the daughter of Pharaoh: Moabite, Ammonite, Edomite, Sidonian, and Hittite women, <span id="v11011002" class="verse-num">2</span>from the nations concerning which the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> had said to the people of Israel, &ldquo;You shall not enter into marriage with them, neither shall they with you, for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods.&rdquo; Solomon clung to these in love. <span id="v11011003" class="verse-num">3</span>He had 700 wives, who were princesses, and 300 concubines. And his wives turned away his heart. <span id="v11011004" class="verse-num">4</span>For when Solomon was old his wives turned away his heart after other gods, and his heart was not wholly true to the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> his God, as was the heart of David his father. <span id="v11011005" class="verse-num">5</span>For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites. <span id="v11011006" class="verse-num">6</span>So Solomon did what was evil in the sight of the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> and did not wholly follow the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>, as David his father had done. <span id="v11011007" class="verse-num">7</span>Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for Molech the abomination of the Ammonites, on the mountain east of Jerusalem. <span id="v11011008" class="verse-num">8</span>And so he did for all his foreign wives, who made offerings and sacrificed to their gods.</p>
<p id="v11011009" class="heading">The L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> Raises Adversaries</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">9</span>And the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> was angry with Solomon, because his heart had turned away from the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice <span id="v11011010" class="verse-num">10</span>and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods. But he did not keep what the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> commanded. <span id="v11011011" class="verse-num">11</span>Therefore the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> said to Solomon, &ldquo;Since this has been your practice and you have not kept my covenant and my statutes that I have commanded you, I will surely tear the kingdom from you and will give it to your servant. <span id="v11011012" class="verse-num">12</span>Yet for the sake of David your father I will not do it in your days, but I will tear it out of the hand of your son. <span id="v11011013" class="verse-num">13</span>However, I will not tear away all the kingdom, but I will give one tribe to your son, for the sake of David my servant and for the sake of Jerusalem that I have chosen.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="normal" id="v11011014"> <span class="verse-num">14</span>And the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> raised up an adversary against Solomon, Hadad the Edomite. He was of the royal house in Edom. <span id="v11011015" class="verse-num">15</span>For when David was in Edom, and Joab the commander of the army went up to bury the slain, he struck down every male in Edom <span id="v11011016" class="verse-num">16</span>(for Joab and all Israel remained there six months, until he had cut off every male in Edom). <span id="v11011017" class="verse-num">17</span>But Hadad fled to Egypt, together with certain Edomites of his father&rsquo;s servants, Hadad still being a little child. <span id="v11011018" class="verse-num">18</span>They set out from Midian and came to Paran and took men with them from Paran and came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house and assigned him an allowance of food and gave him land. <span id="v11011019" class="verse-num">19</span>And Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him in marriage the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen. <span id="v11011020" class="verse-num">20</span>And the sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh&rsquo;s house. And Genubath was in Pharaoh&rsquo;s house among the sons of Pharaoh. <span id="v11011021" class="verse-num">21</span>But when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers and that Joab the commander of the army was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, &ldquo;Let me depart, that I may go to my own country.&rdquo; <span id="v11011022" class="verse-num">22</span>But Pharaoh said to him, &ldquo;What have you lacked with me that you are now seeking to go to your own country?&rdquo; And he said to him, &ldquo;Only let me depart.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="normal" id="v11011023"> <span class="verse-num">23</span>God also raised up as an adversary to him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his master Hadadezer king of Zobah. <span id="v11011024" class="verse-num">24</span>And he gathered men about him and became leader of a marauding band, after the killing by David. And they went to Damascus and lived there and made him king in Damascus. <span id="v11011025" class="verse-num">25</span>He was an adversary of Israel all the days of Solomon, doing harm as Hadad did. And he loathed Israel and reigned over Syria.</p>
<p class="normal" id="v11011026"> <span class="verse-num">26</span>Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother&rsquo;s name was Zeruah, a widow, also lifted up his hand against the king. <span id="v11011027" class="verse-num">27</span>And this was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king. Solomon built the Millo, and closed up the breach of the city of David his father. <span id="v11011028" class="verse-num">28</span>The man Jeroboam was very able, and when Solomon saw that the young man was industrious he gave him charge over all the forced labor of the house of Joseph. <span id="v11011029" class="verse-num">29</span>And at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him on the road. Now Ahijah had dressed himself in a new garment, and the two of them were alone in the open country. <span id="v11011030" class="verse-num">30</span>Then Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him, and tore it into twelve pieces. <span id="v11011031" class="verse-num">31</span>And he said to Jeroboam, &ldquo;Take for yourself ten pieces, for thus says the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>, the God of Israel, &lsquo;Behold, I am about to tear the kingdom from the hand of Solomon and will give you ten tribes <span id="v11011032" class="verse-num">32</span>(but he shall have one tribe, for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city that I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel), <span id="v11011033" class="verse-num">33</span>because they have<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b11.00.1-Kings.footnotes.html#f11011033.1" id="b11011033.1">[1]</a></span> forsaken me and worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the Ammonites, and they have not walked in my ways, doing what is right in my sight and keeping my statutes and my rules, as David his father did. <span id="v11011034" class="verse-num">34</span>Nevertheless, I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand, but I will make him ruler all the days of his life, for the sake of David my servant whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my statutes. <span id="v11011035" class="verse-num">35</span>But I will take the kingdom out of his son&rsquo;s hand and will give it to you, ten tribes. <span id="v11011036" class="verse-num">36</span>Yet to his son I will give one tribe, that David my servant may always have a lamp before me in Jerusalem, the city where I have chosen to put my name. <span id="v11011037" class="verse-num">37</span>And I will take you, and you shall reign over all that your soul desires, and you shall be king over Israel. <span id="v11011038" class="verse-num">38</span>And if you will listen to all that I command you, and will walk in my ways, and do what is right in my eyes by keeping my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did, I will be with you and will build you a sure house, as I built for David, and I will give Israel to you. <span id="v11011039" class="verse-num">39</span>And I will afflict the offspring of David because of this, but not forever.&rsquo;&rdquo; <span id="v11011040" class="verse-num">40</span>Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. But Jeroboam arose and fled into Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.</p>
<p class="normal" id="v11011041"> <span class="verse-num">41</span>Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the Book of the Acts of Solomon? <span id="v11011042" class="verse-num">42</span>And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years. <span id="v11011043" class="verse-num">43</span>And Solomon slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David his father.

<p id="v11012001" class="heading">Rehoboam&rsquo;s Folly</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="book-name"><a href="b11.00.1-Kings.main.html#a1-kings-main">1 KINGS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 12 </span>Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king. <span id="v11012002" class="verse-num">2</span>And as soon as Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it (for he was still in Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon), then Jeroboam returned from<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b11.00.1-Kings.footnotes.html#f11012002.1" id="b11012002.1">[1]</a></span> Egypt. <span id="v11012003" class="verse-num">3</span>And they sent and called him, and Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came and said to Rehoboam, <span id="v11012004" class="verse-num">4</span>&ldquo;Your father made our yoke heavy. Now therefore lighten the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke on us, and we will serve you.&rdquo; <span id="v11012005" class="verse-num">5</span>He said to them, &ldquo;Go away for three days, then come again to me.&rdquo; So the people went away.</p>
<p class="normal" id="v11012006"> <span class="verse-num">6</span>Then King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, who had stood before Solomon his father while he was yet alive, saying, &ldquo;How do you advise me to answer this people?&rdquo; <span id="v11012007" class="verse-num">7</span>And they said to him, &ldquo;If you will be a servant to this people today and serve them, and speak good words to them when you answer them, then they will be your servants forever.&rdquo; <span id="v11012008" class="verse-num">8</span>But he abandoned the counsel that the old men gave him and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him and stood before him. <span id="v11012009" class="verse-num">9</span>And he said to them, &ldquo;What do you advise that we answer this people who have said to me, &lsquo;Lighten the yoke that your father put on us&rsquo;?&rdquo; <span id="v11012010" class="verse-num">10</span>And the young men who had grown up with him said to him, &ldquo;Thus shall you speak to this people who said to you, &lsquo;Your father made our yoke heavy, but you lighten it for us,&rsquo; thus shall you say to them, &lsquo;My little finger is thicker than my father&rsquo;s thighs. <span id="v11012011" class="verse-num">11</span>And now, whereas my father laid on you a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="normal" id="v11012012"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king said, &ldquo;Come to me again the third day.&rdquo; <span id="v11012013" class="verse-num">13</span>And the king answered the people harshly, and forsaking the counsel that the old men had given him, <span id="v11012014" class="verse-num">14</span>he spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, &ldquo;My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.&rdquo; <span id="v11012015" class="verse-num">15</span>So the king did not listen to the people, for it was a turn of affairs brought about by the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> that he might fulfill his word, which the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</p>
<p id="v11012016" class="heading">The Kingdom Divided</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">16</span>And when all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people answered the king, &ldquo;What portion do we have in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. To your tents, O Israel! Look now to your own house, David.&rdquo; So Israel went to their tents. <span id="v11012017" class="verse-num">17</span>But Rehoboam reigned over the people of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah. <span id="v11012018" class="verse-num">18</span>Then King Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was taskmaster over the forced labor, and all Israel stoned him to death with stones. And King Rehoboam hurried to mount his chariot to flee to Jerusalem. <span id="v11012019" class="verse-num">19</span>So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day. <span id="v11012020" class="verse-num">20</span>And when all Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned, they sent and called him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel. There was none that followed the house of David but the tribe of Judah only.</p>
<p class="normal" id="v11012021"> <span class="verse-num">21</span>When Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin, 180,000 chosen warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to restore the kingdom to Rehoboam the son of Solomon. <span id="v11012022" class="verse-num">22</span>But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God: <span id="v11012023" class="verse-num">23</span>&ldquo;Say to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people, <span id="v11012024" class="verse-num">24</span>&lsquo;Thus says the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>, You shall not go up or fight against your relatives the people of Israel.

<p id="v11012025" class="heading">Jeroboam&rsquo;s Golden Calves</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">25</span>Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and lived there.
