We also are men, of like nature with you, and we bring you good news, that you should turn from these vain things to a living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them. <span id="v44014016" class="verse-num">16</span>In past generations he allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways. <span id="v44014017" class="verse-num">17</span>Yet he did not leave himself without witness, for he did good by giving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness.&rdquo; <span id="v44014018" class="verse-num">18</span>Even with these words they scarcely restrained the people from offering sacrifice to them.</p>

<p class="normal" id="v44015006"> <span class="verse-num">6</span>The apostles and the elders were gathered together to consider this matter. <span id="v44015007" class="verse-num">7</span>And after there had been much debate, Peter stood up and said to them, &ldquo;Brothers, you know that in the early days God made a choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe. <span id="v44015008" class="verse-num">8</span>And God, who knows the heart, bore witness to them, by giving them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us, <span id="v44015009" class="verse-num">9</span>and he made no distinction between us and them, having cleansed their hearts by faith. <span id="v44015010" class="verse-num">10</span>Now, therefore, why are you putting God to the test by placing a yoke on the neck of the disciples that neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear? <span id="v44015011" class="verse-num">11</span>But we believe that we will be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they will.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="normal" id="v44015012"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>And all the assembly fell silent, and they listened to Barnabas and Paul as they related what signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles. <span id="v44015013" class="verse-num">13</span>After they finished speaking, James replied, &ldquo;Brothers, listen to me. <span id="v44015014" class="verse-num">14</span>Simeon has related how God first visited the Gentiles, to take from them a people for his name. <span id="v44015015" class="verse-num">15</span>And with this the words of the prophets agree, just as it is written,</p>

<p id="v44015019" class="no-indent-line-space"> <span class="verse-num">19</span>Therefore my judgment is that we should not trouble those of the Gentiles who turn to God, <span id="v44015020" class="verse-num">20</span>but should write to them to abstain from the things polluted by idols, and from sexual immorality, and from what has been strangled, and from blood. <span id="v44015021" class="verse-num">21</span>For from ancient generations Moses has had in every city those who proclaim him, for he is read every Sabbath in the synagogues.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="v44015022" class="heading">The Council&rsquo;s Letter to Gentile Believers</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">22</span>Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men from among them and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas.

<p class="normal" id="v44015030"> <span class="verse-num">30</span>So when they were sent off, they went down to Antioch, and having gathered the congregation together, they delivered the letter. <span id="v44015031" class="verse-num">31</span>And when they had read it, they rejoiced because of its encouragement. <span id="v44015032" class="verse-num">32</span>And Judas and Silas, who were themselves prophets, encouraged and strengthened the brothers with many words. <span id="v44015033" class="verse-num">33</span>And after they had spent some time, they were sent off in peace by the brothers to those who had sent them.<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b44.00.Acts.footnotes.html#f44015033.1" id="b44015033.1">[5]</a></span> <span id="v44015035" class="verse-num">35</span>But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.</p>

<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">36</span>And after some days Paul said to Barnabas, &ldquo;Let us return and visit the brothers in every city where we proclaimed the word of the Lord, and see how they are.&rdquo; <span id="v44015037" class="verse-num">37</span>Now Barnabas wanted to take with them John called Mark. <span id="v44015038" class="verse-num">38</span>But Paul thought best not to take with them one who had withdrawn from them in Pamphylia and had not gone with them to the work. <span id="v44015039" class="verse-num">39</span>And there arose a sharp disagreement, so that they separated from each other.

<p id="v44016011" class="heading">The Conversion of Lydia</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">11</span>So, setting sail from Troas, we made a direct voyage to Samothrace, and the following day to Neapolis, <span id="v44016012" class="verse-num">12</span>and from there to Philippi, which is a leading city of the<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b44.00.Acts.footnotes.html#f44016012.1" id="b44016012.1">[4]</a></span> district of Macedonia and a Roman colony.

The Lord opened her heart to pay attention to what was said by Paul. <span id="v44016015" class="verse-num">15</span>And after she was baptized, and her household as well, she urged us, saying, &ldquo;If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come to my house and stay.&rdquo; And she prevailed upon us.</p>
<p id="v44016016" class="heading">Paul and Silas in Prison</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">16</span>As we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a slave girl who had a spirit of divination and brought her owners much gain by fortune-telling. <span id="v44016017" class="verse-num">17</span>She followed Paul and us, crying out, &ldquo;These men are servants<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b44.00.Acts.footnotes.html#f44016017.1" id="b44016017.1">[5]</a></span> of the Most High God, who proclaim to you the way of salvation.&rdquo; <span id="v44016018" class="verse-num">18</span>And this she kept doing for many days.

But when they had waited a long time and saw no misfortune come to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god.</p>
<p class="normal" id="v44028007"> <span class="verse-num">7</span>Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius, who received us and entertained us hospitably for three days. <span id="v44028008" class="verse-num">8</span>It happened that the father of Publius lay sick with fever and dysentery. And Paul visited him and prayed, and putting his hands on him healed him. <span id="v44028009" class="verse-num">9</span>And when this had taken place, the rest of the people on the island who had diseases also came and were cured. <span id="v44028010" class="verse-num">10</span>They also honored us greatly,<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b44.00.Acts.footnotes.html#f44028010.1" id="b44028010.1">[3]</a></span> and when we were about to sail, they put on board whatever we needed.</p>

<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">11</span>After three months we set sail in a ship that had wintered in the island, a ship of Alexandria, with the twin gods<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b44.00.Acts.footnotes.html#f44028011.1" id="b44028011.1">[4]</a></span> as a figurehead. <span id="v44028012" class="verse-num">12</span>Putting in at Syracuse, we stayed there for three days. <span id="v44028013" class="verse-num">13</span>And from there we made a circuit and arrived at Rhegium.

On seeing them, Paul thanked God and took courage. <span id="v44028016" class="verse-num">16</span>And when we came into Rome, Paul was allowed to stay by himself, with the soldier who guarded him.</p>
