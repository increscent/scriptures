And Isaac went to Gerar to Abimelech king of the Philistines. <span id="v01026002" class="verse-num">2</span>And the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> appeared to him and said, &ldquo;Do not go down to Egypt; dwell in the land of which I shall tell you. <span id="v01026003" class="verse-num">3</span>Sojourn in this land, and I will be with you and will bless you, for to you and to your offspring I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath that I swore to Abraham your father. <span id="v01026004" class="verse-num">4</span>I will multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven and will give to your offspring all these lands. And in your offspring all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, <span id="v01026005" class="verse-num">5</span>because Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="v01026006" class="heading">Isaac and Abimelech</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">6</span>So Isaac settled in Gerar. <span id="v01026007" class="verse-num">7</span>When the men of the place asked him about his wife, he said, &ldquo;She is my sister,&rdquo; for he feared to say, &ldquo;My wife,&rdquo; thinking, &ldquo;lest the men of the place should kill me because of Rebekah,&rdquo; because she was attractive in appearance. <span id="v01026008" class="verse-num">8</span>When he had been there a long time, Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out of a window and saw Isaac laughing with<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b01.00.Genesis.footnotes.html#f01026008.1" id="b01026008.1">[1]</a></span> Rebekah his wife. <span id="v01026009" class="verse-num">9</span>So Abimelech called Isaac and said, &ldquo;Behold, she is your wife. How then could you say, &lsquo;She is my sister&rsquo;?&rdquo; Isaac said to him, &ldquo;Because I thought, &lsquo;Lest I die because of her.&rsquo;&rdquo; <span id="v01026010" class="verse-num">10</span>Abimelech said, &ldquo;What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us.&rdquo; <span id="v01026011" class="verse-num">11</span>So Abimelech warned all the people, saying, &ldquo;Whoever touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="normal" id="v01026012"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>And Isaac sowed in that land and reaped in the same year a hundredfold. The L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> blessed him, <span id="v01026013" class="verse-num">13</span>and the man became rich, and gained more and more until he became very wealthy. <span id="v01026014" class="verse-num">14</span>He had possessions of flocks and herds and many servants, so that the Philistines envied him. <span id="v01026015" class="verse-num">15</span>(Now the Philistines had stopped and filled with earth all the wells that his father&rsquo;s servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father.) <span id="v01026016" class="verse-num">16</span>And Abimelech said to Isaac, &ldquo;Go away from us, for you are much mightier than we.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="normal" id="v01026017"> <span class="verse-num">17</span>So Isaac departed from there and encamped in the Valley of Gerar and settled there. <span id="v01026018" class="verse-num">18</span>And Isaac dug again the wells of water that had been dug in the days of Abraham his father, which the Philistines had stopped after the death of Abraham. And he gave them the names that his father had given them. <span id="v01026019" class="verse-num">19</span>But when Isaac&rsquo;s servants dug in the valley and found there a well of spring water, <span id="v01026020" class="verse-num">20</span>the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac&rsquo;s herdsmen, saying, &ldquo;The water is ours.&rdquo; So he called the name of the well Esek,<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b01.00.Genesis.footnotes.html#f01026020.1" id="b01026020.1">[2]</a></span> because they contended with him. <span id="v01026021" class="verse-num">21</span>Then they dug another well, and they quarreled over that also, so he called its name Sitnah.<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b01.00.Genesis.footnotes.html#f01026021.1" id="b01026021.1">[3]</a></span> <span id="v01026022" class="verse-num">22</span>And he moved from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it.

<p class="normal" id="v01026023"> <span class="verse-num">23</span>From there he went up to Beersheba. <span id="v01026024" class="verse-num">24</span>And the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> appeared to him the same night and said, &ldquo;I am the God of Abraham your father. Fear not, for I am with you and will bless you and multiply your offspring for my servant Abraham&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo; <span id="v01026025" class="verse-num">25</span>So he built an altar there and called upon the name of the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> and pitched his tent there.

<p class="normal" id="v01026026"> <span class="verse-num">26</span>When Abimelech went to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath his adviser and Phicol the commander of his army, <span id="v01026027" class="verse-num">27</span>Isaac said to them, &ldquo;Why have you come to me, seeing that you hate me and have sent me away from you?&rdquo; <span id="v01026028" class="verse-num">28</span>They said, &ldquo;We see plainly that the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> has been with you.

You are now the blessed of the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>.&rdquo; <span id="v01026030" class="verse-num">30</span>So he made them a feast, and they ate and drank. <span id="v01026031" class="verse-num">31</span>In the morning they rose early and exchanged oaths.
