<p class="normal" id="v55002008"> <span class="verse-num">8</span>Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, the offspring of David, as preached in my gospel, <span id="v55002009" class="verse-num">9</span>for which I am suffering, bound with chains as a criminal.

Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus, <span id="v55002018" class="verse-num">18</span>who have swerved from the truth, saying that the resurrection has already happened. They are upsetting the faith of some. <span id="v55002019" class="verse-num">19</span>But God&rsquo;s firm foundation stands, bearing this seal: &ldquo;The Lord knows those who are his,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="normal" id="v55002020"> <span class="verse-num">20</span>Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver but also of wood and clay, some for honorable use, some for dishonorable. <span id="v55002021" class="verse-num">21</span>Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from what is dishonorable,<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b55.00.2-Timothy.footnotes.html#f55002021.1" id="b55002021.1">[4]</a></span> he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart as holy, useful to the master of the house, ready for every good work.</p>

God may perhaps grant them repentance leading to a knowledge of the truth, <span id="v55002026" class="verse-num">26</span>and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil, after being captured by him to do his will.</p>

<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">9</span>Do your best to come to me soon. <span id="v55004010" class="verse-num">10</span>For Demas, in love with this present world, has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica.
