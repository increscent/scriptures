<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">8</span>Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who did not know Joseph. <span id="v02001009" class="verse-num">9</span>And he said to his people, &ldquo;Behold, the people of Israel are too many and too mighty for us. <span id="v02001010" class="verse-num">10</span>Come, let us deal shrewdly with them, lest they multiply, and, if war breaks out, they join our enemies and fight against us and escape from the land.&rdquo; <span id="v02001011" class="verse-num">11</span>Therefore they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with heavy burdens.
