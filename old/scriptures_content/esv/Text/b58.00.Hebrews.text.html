<p id="v58002005" class="heading">The Founder of Salvation</p>

<p class="normal" id="v58002010"> <span class="verse-num">10</span>For it was fitting that he, for whom and by whom all things exist, in bringing many sons to glory, should make the founder of their salvation perfect through suffering. <span id="v58002011" class="verse-num">11</span>For he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one source.<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b58.00.Hebrews.footnotes.html#f58002011.1" id="b58002011.1">[2]</a></span> That is why he is not ashamed to call them brothers,<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b58.00.Hebrews.footnotes.html#f58002011.2" id="b58002011.2">[3]</a></span> <span id="v58002012" class="verse-num">12</span>saying,</p>

<p id="v58002014" class="line-space"> <span class="verse-num">14</span>Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same things, that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil, <span id="v58002015" class="verse-num">15</span>and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery. <span id="v58002016" class="verse-num">16</span>For surely it is not angels that he helps, but he helps the offspring of Abraham. <span id="v58002017" class="verse-num">17</span>Therefore he had to be made like his brothers in every respect, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people. <span id="v58002018" class="verse-num">18</span>For because he himself has suffered when tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.</p>

<p id="v58003016" class="no-indent-line-space"> <span class="verse-num">16</span>For who were those who heard and yet rebelled?

Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness? <span id="v58003018" class="verse-num">18</span>And to whom did he swear that they would not enter his rest, but to those who were disobedient? <span id="v58003019" class="verse-num">19</span>So we see that they were unable to enter because of unbelief.</p>

<p class="no-indent-line-space">although his works were finished from the foundation of the world. <span id="v58004004" class="verse-num">4</span>For he has somewhere spoken of the seventh day in this way: &ldquo;And God rested on the seventh day from all his works.&rdquo; <span id="v58004005" class="verse-num">5</span>And again in this passage he said,</p>

<p class="normal" id="v58005005"> <span class="verse-num">5</span>So also Christ did not exalt himself to be made a high priest, but was appointed by him who said to him,</p>

<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">3</span>Consider him who endured from sinners such hostility against himself, so that you may not grow weary or fainthearted. <span id="v58012004" class="verse-num">4</span>In your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood. <span id="v58012005" class="verse-num">5</span>And have you forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons?</p>
<p class="line-group"> &ldquo;My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord,</p>

<p id="v58012007" class="no-indent-line-space"> <span class="verse-num">7</span>It is for discipline that you have to endure. God is treating you as sons. For what son is there whom his father does not discipline? <span id="v58012008" class="verse-num">8</span>If you are left without discipline, in which all have participated, then you are illegitimate children and not sons. <span id="v58012009" class="verse-num">9</span>Besides this, we have had earthly fathers who disciplined us and we respected them. Shall we not much more be subject to the Father of spirits and live? <span id="v58012010" class="verse-num">10</span>For they disciplined us for a short time as it seemed best to them, but he disciplines us for our good, that we may share his holiness. <span id="v58012011" class="verse-num">11</span>For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.</p>
