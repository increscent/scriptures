<p>When they told David, &ldquo;It was the men of Jabesh-gilead who buried Saul,&rdquo; <span id="v10002005" class="verse-num">5</span>David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-gilead and said to them, &ldquo;May you be blessed by the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>, because you showed this loyalty to Saul your lord and buried him. <span id="v10002006" class="verse-num">6</span>Now may the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> show steadfast love and faithfulness to you.

<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">8</span>But Abner the son of Ner, commander of Saul&rsquo;s army, took Ish-bosheth the son of Saul and brought him over to Mahanaim, <span id="v10002009" class="verse-num">9</span>and he made him king over Gilead and the Ashurites and Jezreel and Ephraim and Benjamin and all Israel. <span id="v10002010" class="verse-num">10</span>Ish-bosheth, Saul&rsquo;s son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years.

<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon. <span id="v10002013" class="verse-num">13</span>And Joab the son of Zeruiah and the servants of David went out and met them at the pool of Gibeon.

<p class="normal" id="v10002018"> <span class="verse-num">18</span>And the three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. Now Asahel was as swift of foot as a wild gazelle. <span id="v10002019" class="verse-num">19</span>And Asahel pursued Abner, and as he went, he turned neither to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner. <span id="v10002020" class="verse-num">20</span>Then Abner looked behind him and said, &ldquo;Is it you, Asahel?&rdquo; And he answered, &ldquo;It is I.&rdquo; <span id="v10002021" class="verse-num">21</span>Abner said to him, &ldquo;Turn aside to your right hand or to your left, and seize one of the young men and take his spoil.&rdquo; But Asahel would not turn aside from following him. <span id="v10002022" class="verse-num">22</span>And Abner said again to Asahel, &ldquo;Turn aside from following me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then could I lift up my face to your brother Joab?&rdquo; <span id="v10002023" class="verse-num">23</span>But he refused to turn aside. Therefore Abner struck him in the stomach with the butt of his spear, so that the spear came out at his back. And he fell there and died where he was. And all who came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died, stood still.</p>
<p class="normal" id="v10002024"> <span class="verse-num">24</span>But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner. And as the sun was going down they came to the hill of Ammah, which lies before Giah on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon. <span id="v10002025" class="verse-num">25</span>And the people of Benjamin gathered themselves together behind Abner and became one group and took their stand on the top of a hill. <span id="v10002026" class="verse-num">26</span>Then Abner called to Joab, &ldquo;Shall the sword devour forever? Do you not know that the end will be bitter? How long will it be before you tell your people to turn from the pursuit of their brothers?&rdquo; <span id="v10002027" class="verse-num">27</span>And Joab said, &ldquo;As God lives, if you had not spoken, surely the men would not have given up the pursuit of their brothers until the morning.&rdquo; <span id="v10002028" class="verse-num">28</span>So Joab blew the trumpet, and all the men stopped and pursued Israel no more, nor did they fight anymore.</p>
<p class="normal" id="v10002029"> <span class="verse-num">29</span>And Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah. They crossed the Jordan, and marching the whole morning, they came to Mahanaim. <span id="v10002030" class="verse-num">30</span>Joab returned from the pursuit of Abner. And when he had gathered all the people together, there were missing from David&rsquo;s servants nineteen men besides Asahel. <span id="v10002031" class="verse-num">31</span>But the servants of David had struck down of Benjamin 360 of Abner&rsquo;s men. <span id="v10002032" class="verse-num">32</span>And they took up Asahel and buried him in the tomb of his father, which was at Bethlehem.

<p class="normal" id="v10003012"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf,<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b10.00.2-Samuel.footnotes.html#f10003012.1" id="b10003012.1">[1]</a></span> saying, &ldquo;To whom does the land belong?

<p class="normal" id="v10003017"> <span class="verse-num">17</span>And Abner conferred with the elders of Israel, saying, &ldquo;For some time past you have been seeking David as king over you. <span id="v10003018" class="verse-num">18</span>Now then bring it about, for the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> has promised David, saying, &lsquo;By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel from the hand of the Philistines, and from the hand of all their enemies.&rsquo;&rdquo; <span id="v10003019" class="verse-num">19</span>Abner also spoke to Benjamin.

<p class="normal" id="v10003020"> <span class="verse-num">20</span>When Abner came with twenty men to David at Hebron, David made a feast for Abner and the men who were with him. <span id="v10003021" class="verse-num">21</span>And Abner said to David, &ldquo;I will arise and go and will gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may reign over all that your heart desires.&rdquo; So David sent Abner away, and he went in peace.</p>
<p class="normal" id="v10003022"> <span class="verse-num">22</span>Just then the servants of David arrived with Joab from a raid, bringing much spoil with them.

<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">26</span>When Joab came out from David&rsquo;s presence, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the cistern of Sirah.

<p id="v10003031" class="heading">David Mourns Abner</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">31</span>Then David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him, &ldquo;Tear your clothes and put on sackcloth and mourn before Abner.&rdquo; And King David followed the bier. <span id="v10003032" class="verse-num">32</span>They buried Abner at Hebron.

<p id="v10024018" class="heading">David Builds an Altar</p>
<p class="no-indent"> <span class="verse-num">18</span>And Gad came that day to David and said to him, &ldquo;Go up, raise an altar to the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.&rdquo; <span id="v10024019" class="verse-num">19</span>So David went up at Gad&rsquo;s word, as the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> commanded. <span id="v10024020" class="verse-num">20</span>And when Araunah looked down, he saw the king and his servants coming on toward him. And Araunah went out and paid homage to the king with his face to the ground. <span id="v10024021" class="verse-num">21</span>And Araunah said, &ldquo;Why has my lord the king come to his servant?&rdquo; David said, &ldquo;To buy the threshing floor from you, in order to build an altar to the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span>, that the plague may be averted from the people.&rdquo; <span id="v10024022" class="verse-num">22</span>Then Araunah said to David, &ldquo;Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him. Here are the oxen for the burnt offering and the threshing sledges and the yokes of the oxen for the wood. <span id="v10024023" class="verse-num">23</span>All this, O king, Araunah gives to the king.&rdquo; And Araunah said to the king, &ldquo;May the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> your God accept you.&rdquo; <span id="v10024024" class="verse-num">24</span>But the king said to Araunah, &ldquo;No, but I will buy it from you for a price. I will not offer burnt offerings to the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> my God that cost me nothing.&rdquo; So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="b10.00.2-Samuel.footnotes.html#f10024024.1" id="b10024024.1">[7]</a></span> of silver. <span id="v10024025" class="verse-num">25</span>And David built there an altar to the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> responded to the plea for the land, and the plague was averted from Israel.</p>
